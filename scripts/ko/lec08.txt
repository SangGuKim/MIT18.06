# Introduction
0:00
0:05
OK, when the camera says, we'll start. You want to give me a signal?
0:13
OK, this is lecture eight in linear algebra, and this is the lecture where we completely
0:20
solve linear equations. So Ax=b.
0:27
That's our goal. If it has a solution.
0:32
It certainly can happen that there is no solution. We have to identify that possibility by elimination.
0:40
And then if there is a solution we want to find out is there only one solution or are -- is there a whole family
0:48
of solutions, and then find them all. OK. Can I use as an example the same matrix
0:57
that I had last time when we were looking for the null space.
1:02
So the, the matrix has rows 1 2 2 2, 2 4 6 8,
1:10
and the third row -- you remember the main point was the third row, 3 6 8 10, is the sum of row one plus row two.
1:21
In other words, if I add those left-hand sides, I get the third left-hand side.
1:28
So you can tell me right away what elimination is going to discover about the right-hand sides.
1:35
What's -- there is a condition on b1, b2,
1:41
and b3 for this system to have a solution. Most cases -- if I took these numbers to be one --
1:50
5, and 17, there would not be a solution. In fact, if I took those first numbers to be 1 and 5,
1:58
what is the only b3 that would be OK? Six.
2:05
If the left-hand -- if these left-hand sides add up to that, then B --
2:10
I need b1 plus b2 to equal b3. Let's just see how elimination discovers that.
2:19
But we can see it coming, right? That if -- let me say it in other words.
2:26
If some combination on the left-hand side gives all 0s then the same combination
2:33
on the right-hand side must give 0. OK. So let me take that example and write down
# Example
2:43
instead of copying out all the plus signs, let me write down the matrix.
2:49
1 2 2 2, 2 4 6 8, and that 6 3 8 10,
2:59
where the third row is the sum of the first two rows. Now how do we deal with the right-hand side?
3:06
That's -- we want to do the same thing to the right-hand side that we're doing to these rows on the left side,
3:12
so we just tack on the right-hand side as another
3:17
vector, another column. So this is the augmented matrix.
3:26
It's, it's the matrix A with the vector b tacked on.
3:35
In Matlab, that's all you would need to type. OK. So we do elimination on that.
3:41
Can we just do elimination quickly? The first pivot is fine, I subtract two of this
3:46
away from this, three of this away from this, so I have 1 2 2 2 b1.
3:54
Two of those away will give me 0 0 2 and 4,
4:00
and that was b2 minus two b1. I, I have to do the same thing to that third,
4:07
that last column. And then three of these away from this gave me 0 0 2 4 b3 minus three b1s.
4:17
So that's the, that's elimination with the first column completed.
4:25
We move on. There's the first pivot still. Here is the second pivot.
4:31
We're always remembering, now, these are then going to be the pivot columns.
4:36
4:41
And let me get the final result -- well, let me --
4:47
can I do it by eraser?
4:55
We're capable of subtracting this row from this row,
5:00
just by -- that'll knock this out completely and give me the row of 0s, and on the right-hand side,
5:08
when I subtract this away from this, what do I have?
5:16
I think I have b3 minus a b2, and I had minus three b1s.
5:22
This is going to, it's going to be a minus a b1. Oh yeah that's exactly what I expect.
5:28
So now the -- what's the last equation?
5:34
The last equation, this represented by this zero row, that last equation is, says 0 equals b3 minus b2 minus b1.
5:45
So that's the condition for solvability.
5:51
That's the condition on the right-hand side that we expected. It says that b1+b2 has to match b3,
5:57
and if our numbers happen to have been 1, 5, and 6 -- so let me take, suppose b is 1 5 6.
6:07
That's an OK b. And when I do this elimination, what will I have?
6:13
The b1 will still be a 1. b2 would be 5 minus 2, this would be a 3.
6:18
5 -- my 6 minus 5 minus 1, this will be --
6:24
this is the main point -- this will be a 0, thanks. OK.
6:30
So the last equation is OK now.
6:37
And I can proceed to solve the two equations that are really there with four unknowns.
6:44
OK, I, I, I want to do that, so this, this b is OK. It allows a solution.
6:51
We're going to be, naturally, interested
6:56
to keep track what are the conditions on b that
7:04
make the equation solvable. So let me write down what we already see
7:11
before I continue to solve it. Let me first -- solvability, solvability.
7:17
7:23
So which -- so this is the condition on the right-hand
7:31
sides. And what is that condition? This is solvability always of Ax=b.
7:39
So Ax=b is solvable --
7:45
well, actually, we had an answer in the language of the column
7:50
space. Can you remind me what that answer is? That, that was like our answer from earlier lecture.
7:58
b had to be in the column space. Solvable if -- when -- exactly when b is in the column space
8:10
of A. Right? That just says that b has to be a combination of the columns,
8:17
and of course that's exactly what the equation is looking for. So that -- now I want to answer it --
8:25
the same answer but in different language. Another way to answer this --
8:33
if a combination of the rows of A gives the zero row,
8:52
and this was an example where it happened, some combination of the rows of A produced the zero row --
9:00
then what's the requirement on b? Since we're going to do the same thing to both sides of all
9:07
equations -- the same combination of the components of b has to give 0.
9:16
Right? That's -- so if there's a combination of the rows that gives the zero row, then the same combination of the entries
9:29
of b must give 0.
9:37
And this isn't the zero row, that's the zero number.
9:43
Tthis is another way of saying -- and it is not immediate, OK. right, that these two statements are equivalent.
9:54
But somehow they must be, because they're both equivalent to the solvability of the system.
9:59
OK. So we've got this, this sort of -- like question zero is,
10:05
does the system have a solution? OK, I'll come back to discuss that further.
10:12
Let's go forward when it does. When there is a solution.
10:19
And so what's our job now? Abstractly we sit back and we say, OK, there's
10:24
a solution, finished. It exists. But we want to construct it. So what's the algorithm, the sequence
10:34
of steps to find the solution? That's what I -- and of course the quiz and the final,
10:42
I'm going to give you a system Ax=b and I'm going to ask you for the solution, if there is one.
10:48
And so this algorithm that you want to follow.
10:54
OK, let's see. So what's the -- so now to find the complete solution to Ax=b.
# Solution
11:13
OK. Let me start by finding one solution, one particular solution.
11:19
I'm expecting that I can, because my system of equations
11:26
now, that last equation is zero equals zero, so that's all fine.
11:33
I really have two equations -- actually I've got four unknowns, so I'm
11:38
expecting to find not only a solution but a whole bunch of them.
11:44
But let's just find one. So step one, a particular solution, x particular.
11:50
How do I find one particular solution?
11:57
Well, let me tell you how I, how I find it. So this is --
12:02
since there are lots of solutions, you could have your own way to find a particular one. But this is a pretty natural way.
12:10
Set all free variables to zero.
12:20
Since those free variables are the guys that can be anything, the most convenient choice is zero.
12:28
And then solve Ax=b for the pivot variables.
12:37
So what does that mean in this example?
12:44
Which are the free variables? Which, which are the variables that we can assign freely
12:49
and then there's one and only one way to find the pivot variables?
12:55
They're x2 and -- so x2 is zero, because that's in a column
13:01
without a pivot, the second column has no pivot. And the -- what's the other one?
13:08
The fourth, x4 is zero. Because that, those are the, the free ones.
13:16
Those are in the columns with no pivots. So you see what my -- so when I knock -- when x2 and x4 are zero, I'm left with the --
13:28
what I left with here? I'm just left with -- see, now I'm not using the two free
13:36
columns. I'm only using the pivot columns. So I'm really left with x1 --
13:42
the first equation is just x1 and two x3s should be the right-hand side, which
13:48
we picked to be a one. And the second equation is two x3s,
13:54
as it happened, turned out to be, three.
14:02
I just write it again here with the x2 and the x4 knocked out, since we're set them to zero.
14:09
And you see that we're back in the normal case of having back -- where back substitution will do it.
14:16
So x3 is three halves, and then we go back up
14:21
and x1 is one minus two x3. That's probably minus two.
14:29
Good. So now we have the solution, x particular is the vector minus two zero three halves zero.
14:41
OK, good. That's one particular solution, and we should and could plug it
14:52
into the original system. Really if -- on the quiz, please, it's a good thing to do.
14:59
So we did all this, these, row operations, but this is supposed to solve the original system,
15:06
and I think it does. OK. So that's x particular which we've got.
15:14
So that's like what's new today. The particular solution comes -- first you check that you have
15:23
zero equals zero, so you're OK on the last equations. And then you set the free variables to zero,
15:31
solve for the pivot variables, and you've got a particular solution, the particular solution that
15:38
has zero free variables. OK. Now -- but that's only one solution,
15:45
and now I'm looking for all. So how do I find the rest?
15:51
The point is I can add on x -- anything out of the null space.
15:58
We know how to find the vectors in the null space --
16:06
because we did it last time, but I'll remind you what we got. And then I'll add.
16:12
So the final result will be that the complete solution --
16:20
this is now the complete guy -- the complete solution is this one particular solution
16:27
plus any, any vector, all different vectors out
16:34
of the null space. xn, OK. Well why, why this pattern, because this pattern shows up
16:42
through all of mathematics, because it shows up everywhere we have linear equations.
16:48
Let me just put here the, the reason. A xp, so that's x particular, so what does Ax particular give?
17:01
That gives the correct right-hand side b. And what does A times an x in the null space give?
17:10
Zero. So I add, and I put in parentheses.
17:17
So xp plus xn is b plus zero, which is b.
17:25
So -- oh, what I saying? Let me just say it in words.
17:30
If I have one solution, I can add on anything
17:36
in the null space, because anything in the null space has a zero right-hand side, and I still
17:43
have the correct right-hand side B. So that's my system. That's my complete solution.
17:50
Now let me write out what that will be for this example. So in this example, x general, x complete,
18:02
the complete solution, is x particular,
18:07
which is minus two zero three halves zero, with those zeroes in the free variable, plus --
18:15
you remember there were the special solutions in the null space that had a one in the free variables --
18:21
or one and zero in the free variables, and then we filled in to find I've forgotten what they were,
18:29
but maybe it was that. the others? That was a special solution, and then there was another special solution that
18:36
had that free variable zero and this free variable equal one, and I have to fill those in.
18:46
Let's see, can I remember how those fill in? Maybe this was a minus two and this was a two,
18:51
possibly? I think probably that's right.
18:57
I'm not -- yeah. Does that look right to you?
19:05
I would have to remember what are my equations. Can I, rather than go way back to that board,
19:11
let me remember the first equation was two x3 plus two x4 equaling zero now,
19:19
because I'm looking for the guys in the null space. So I set x4 to be one and the second equation,
19:28
that I didn't copy again, gave me minus two for this and then -- yeah, so I think that's right.
19:35
Two minus four and two gives zero, check.
19:40
OK. Those were the special solutions. What do we do to get the complete solution?
19:46
How do I get the complete solution now?
19:52
I multiply this by anything, c1, say, and I multiply this by anything --
19:58
I take any combination. Remember that's how we described the null space?
20:04
The null space consists of all combinations of -- so this is xn --
20:10
all combinations of the special solutions. There were two special solutions because there
20:18
were two free variables. And we want to make that count --
20:24
carefully now. Just while I'm up here. So there's, that's what the -- that's the kind of answer
20:30
I'm looking for. Is there a constant multiplying this guy? Is there a free constant that multiplies x particular?
20:38
No way. Right? x particular solves A xp=b.
20:44
I'm not allowed to multiply that by three. But Axn, I'm allowed to multiply xn by three,
20:51
or add to another xn, because I keep getting zero on the right.
20:56
OK. So, so again, xp is one particular guy.
21:02
xn is a whole subspace. Right? It's one guy plus, plus anything from a subspace.
21:09
Let me draw it. Let me try to -- oh.
21:14
I want to draw, I want to graph all this --
21:19
I want to, I want to plot all solutions.
21:25
Now x. So what dimension I in?
21:32
This is a unfortunate point. How many components does x have?
21:38
Four. There are four unknowns. So I have to draw a four dimensional picture on this MIT
21:47
cheap blackboard. OK. So here we go. x1 -- Einstein could do it, but, this, this is --
21:58
those are four perpendicular axes in --
22:06
representing four dimensional space. OK. Where are my solutions?
22:12
Do my solutions form a subspace? Does the set of solutions to Ax=b form a subspace?
22:20
No way. What does it actually look like, though? A subspace is in this picture.
22:26
This part is a subspace, right? That part is some, like, two dimensional,
22:33
because I've got two parameters, so it's -- I'm thinking of this null space as a two dimensional subspace
22:41
inside R^4. Now I have to tell you and will tell you next time,
22:46
what does it mean to say a subspace, what's the dimension of a subspace. But you see what it's going to be.
22:52
It's the number of free independent constants
22:58
that we can choose. So somehow there'll be a two dimensional subspace, not
23:03
a line, and not a three dimensional plane, but only a two dimensional guy.
23:10
But it's doesn't go through the origin because it goes through this point.
23:15
So there's x particular. x particular is somewhere here. x particular.
23:21
So it's somehow a subspace -- can I try to draw it that way?
23:28
It's a two dimensional subspace that goes through x particular
23:36
and then onwards by -- so there's x particular, and I added on xn, and there's x.
23:44
There's x=xp+xn. But the xn was anywhere in this subspace,
23:51
so that filled out a plane.
23:56
It's a subspace -- it's not a subspace, what I saying?
24:02
It's like a flat thing, it's like a subspace, but it's been shifted, away from the origin.
24:08
It doesn't contain zero. Thanks. OK. That's the picture, and that's the algorithm.
24:16
So the algorithm is just go through elimination and, find the particular solution,
24:25
and then find those special solutions. You can do that. Let me take our time here in the lecture to think,
24:34
about the bigger picture. So let me think about --
24:43
so this is my pattern. Now I want to think -- I want to ask you about a question --
# Questions
24:54
I want to ask you some questions. So when I mean think bigger, I mean I'll think about an m
25:01
by n matrix A of rank r.
25:09
OK.
25:15
What's our definition of rank? Our current definition of rank is number of pivots.
25:22
OK. First of all, how are these numbers related? Can you tell me a relation between r and m?
25:31
If I have m rows in the matrix and R pivots, -- then I certainly know, always --
25:42
what relation do I know between r and m? r is less or equal, right?
25:49
Because I've got m rows, I can't have more than m pivots, I might have m and I might have fewer.
25:56
Also, I've got n columns.
26:01
So what's the relation between r and n? It's the same, less or equal, because a column
26:10
can't have more than one pivot. So I can't have more than n pivots altogether.
# Relation between R and N
26:17
OK, OK. So I have an m by n matrix of rank r. And I always know r less than or equal to m, r less than
26:25
or equal to n. Now I'm specially interested in the case of full rank, when the rank r is as big as it can be.
26:35
Well, I guess I've got two separate possibilities here,
26:40
depending on what these numbers m and n are. So let me talk about the case of full column rank.
26:49
And by that I mean r=n.
27:02
And I want to ask you, what does that imply about our solutions?
27:11
What does that tell us about the null space? What does that tell us about, the complete solution?
27:21
OK, so what does that mean? So I want to ask you, well, OK, if the rank is
27:28
n, what does that mean? That means there's a pivot in every column.
27:35
So how many pivot variables are there? n.
27:41
All the columns have pivots in this case. So how many free variables are there?
27:48
None at all. So no free variables. r=n, no free variables.
27:54
So what does that tell us about what's
28:00
going to happen then in our, in our little algorithms? What will be in the null space?
28:07
The null space of A has got what in it?
28:13
Only the zero vector. There are no free variables to give other values to.
28:20
So the null space is only the zero vector.
28:29
And what about our solution to Ax=b? Solution to Ax=b?
28:38
What, what's the story on that one? So now that's coming from today's lecture.
28:43
The solution x is --
28:51
what's the complete solution? It's just x particular, right?
28:59
If, if, if there is an x, if there is a solution. It's x equal x particular.
29:05
There's nothing -- you know, there's just one solution. If there's one at all.
29:11
So it's unique solution -- unique means only one --
29:16
unique solution if it exists, if it exists.
29:22
In other words, I would say -- let me put it a different way.
29:29
There're either zero or one solutions.
29:38
This is all in this case r=n.
29:45
So I'm -- because many, many applications in reality,
29:50
the columns will be what I'll later call independent.
29:55
And we'll have, nothing to look for in the null space,
Creating an example
30:04
and we'll only have particular solutions. OK.
30:09
Everybody see that possibility? But I need an example, right?
30:15
So let me create an example. What sort of a matrix -- what's the shape of a matrix that has
30:23
full column rank? So can I squeeze in an, an example here?
30:30
If it exists. Let me put in an example, and it's just the right space
30:38
to put in an example. Because the example will be like tall and thin.
30:45
It will have -- well, I mean, here's an example, one two six five, three one
30:54
one one. Brilliant example. OK. So there's a matrix A, and what's its rank?
31:06
What's the rank of that matrix? How many pivots will I find if I do elimination?
31:12
Two, right? Two. I see a pivot there --
# Row Reduced Form R
31:20
oh certainly those two columns are headed off in different directions.
31:26
When I do elimination, I'll certainly get another pivot here, fine, and I can use those to clean out below and above.
31:35
So the -- actually, tell me what its row reduced row echelon
31:43
form would be. Can you carry that, that elimination
31:49
process to the bitter end? So what do, what does that mean?
31:54
I subtract a multiple of this row from these rows. So I clean up, all zeros there.
32:00
Then I've got some pivot here. What do I do with that? I go subtract it below and above,
32:07
and then I divide through, and what's R for that example? Maybe I can -- you'll allow me to put that just here
32:14
in the next board. What's the row reduced echelon form, just out of practice,
32:21
for that matrix? It's got ones in the pivots.
32:28
It's got the identity matrix, a little two by two identity matrix, and below it all zeros.
32:34
That's a matrix that really has two independent rows,
32:43
and they're the first two, actually. The first two rows are independent. They're not in the same direction.
32:49
But the other rows are combinations of the first two, so --
32:55
is there always a solution to Ax=b? Tell me what's the picture here?
# Full Column Rank
33:02
For this matrix A, this is a case of full column rank. The two columns are -- give two pivots.
33:11
There's nothing in the null space. There's no combination of those columns that gives the zero column except the zero zero
33:19
combination. So there's nothing in the null space.
Is there always a solution
33:25
But is there always a solution to A X equal B? What's up with A X equal B?
33:31
I've got four, four equations here, and only two Xs.
33:38
So the answer is certainly no. There's not always a solution.
33:45
I may have zero solutions, and if I make a random choice, I'll have zero solutions.
33:51
Or if I make a great particular choice of the right-hand side, which just happens to be a combination of those two guys
33:59
-- like tell me one right-hand side that would have a solution. Tell me a right-hand side that would have a solution.
34:07
Well, 0 0 0 0, OK. No prize for that one.
34:12
Tell me another one. Another right-hand side that has a solution would be 4 3 7 6.
34:18
I could add the two columns. What would be the total complete solution if the
34:25
Right? right-hand side was 4 3 7 6? There would be the particular solution one
What is the complete solution
34:31
one, one of that column plus one of that, and that would be the only solution. So there would be -- x particular would be one one
34:39
in the case when the right side is the sum of those two columns, and that's it.
34:46
So that would be a case with one solution. OK. That, this is the typical setup with full column rank.
34:55
Now I go to full row rank. You see the sort of natural symmetry of this discussion.
# Natural Symmetry
35:04
Full row rank means r=m.
35:14
So this is what I'm interested in now, r=m.
35:19
OK, what's up with that?
# Elimination
35:29
How many pivots? m. So what happens when we do elimination in that case?
35:40
I'm going to get m pivots. So every row has a pivot, right?
35:47
Every row has a pivot. Then what about solvability?
35:55
What about this business of -- for which right-hand sides can I solve it?
36:01
So that's my question. I can solve Ax=b for which right-hand sides?
36:14
Do you see what's coming? I do elimination, I don't get any zero rows.
# Existence
36:23
So there aren't any requirements on b. I can solve Ax=b for every b.
36:29
36:36
I can solve Ax=b for every right-hand side. So this is the existence, exists a solution.
36:46
Now tell me, so the, u- u- so every row has a pivot in it.
# Free variables
36:57
So how many free variables are there? How many free variables in this case?
37:04
If I had n variables to start with, how many are used up by pivot variables?
37:11
r, which is m. So I'm left with, left with n-r free variables.
37:25
37:31
OK. So this case of full row rank I can always solve,
37:37
and then this tells me how many variables are free, and this is of course n-m.
37:43
This is n-m free variables. Can I do an example?
37:48
You know, the best way for me to do an example is just
37:54
to transpose that example. So let me take, let me take that matrix that had column one
38:01
two six five and make it a row. And let me take three one one one as the second row.
38:11
And let me ask you, this is my matrix A, what's its rank?
38:18
What's the rank of that matrix? Sorry to ask, but not sorry really,
38:24
because we're just getting the idea of rank. What's the rank of that matrix?
38:29
Two, exactly, two. There will be two pivots. What will the row reduced echelon form be?
38:36
Anybody know that one? Actually, tell me not only -- you have to tell me not only
38:42
the, there'll be two pivots but which will be the pivot columns. Which columns of this matrix will be pivot columns?
38:50
So the first column is fine, and then I go on to the next column, and what do I get?
38:55
Do I get a second pivot out of -- will I get a second pivot in this position? Yes.
39:01
So the pivots, when I get all the way to R, will be there.
39:07
And here will be some numbers.
39:13
This is the part that I previously called F. This is the part that -- the pivot columns in R will be
39:23
the identity matrix. There are no zero rows, no zero rows, because the rank is two.
39:31
But there'll be stuff over here. And that will, enter the special solutions and the null space.
39:42
OK. So this is a typical matrix with r=m smaller than n.
39:51
Now finally I've got a space here for r=m=n.
40:01
I'm off in the corner here with the most important case of all. So what's up with this matrix?
40:08
So let me give an example. OK, brilliant example, 1 2 3 1.
40:15
Tell me what -- how do I describe a matrix that has rank
40:23
r=m=n? So the matrix is square, right, it's a square matrix.
40:32
And if I know its rank is -- it's full rank, now. I don't have to say full column rank or full row rank --
40:39
I just say full rank, because the count, column count and the row count are the same, and the rank
40:47
is as big as it can be. And what kind of a matrix have I got?
40:53
It's invertible. So that's exactly the invertible matrices.
41:01
r=m=n means the -- what's the row echelon form, the reduced row echelon form, for an invertible matrix?
41:10
For a square, nice, square, invertible matrix? It's I.
41:17
Right. So you see that the, the good matrices
41:25
are the ones that kind of come out trivially in R.
41:31
You reduce them all the way to the identity matrix. What's the null space for this, for this matrix?
41:37
Can I just hammer away with questions? What's the null space for this matrix?
41:43
The null space of that matrix is the zero vector only.
41:51
The zero vector only. What are the conditions to solve Ax=b?
41:58
Which right-hand sides b are OK? If I want to solve Ax=b for this example, so A is this,
42:07
b is b1 b2, what are the conditions on b1 and b2?
42:14
None at all, right. So this is the case, this is the case where I can solve --
42:21
so I've coming back here, I can -- since the rank equals m, I can solve for every b.
42:28
And since the rank is also n, there's a unique solution.
42:33
Let me summarize the whole picture here.
42:39
Here's the whole picture. I could have r=m=n.
42:44
This is the case where this is the identity matrix.
42:51
And this is the case where there is one solution.
42:56
That's the square invertible chapter two case.
43:02
Now we're into chapter three. We could have r=m smaller than n.
43:08
Now that's what we had over there,
43:13
and the row echelon form looked like the identity with some zero rows.
43:18
And that was the case where there are zero or one solution.
43:27
When I say solution I mean to Ax=b.
43:34
So this case, there's always one.
43:39
This case there's zero or one. And now let me take the case of full column rank,
43:45
but some, extra rows.
43:55
So now R has -- well, the identity --
44:04
I'm almost tempted to write the identity matrix and then F, but that isn't necessarily right.
44:10
44:15
I have -- is that right? Am I getting this correct here?
44:24
Oh, I'm not! My God! This is the case R equals n, the columns, the columns are,
44:33
are OK. That's the case that was on that board, r=n, full column rank.
44:38
Now I want the case where m is smaller than n and I've got extra columns.
44:46
OK. There we go.
44:52
So this is now the case of full row rank,
44:57
and it looks like I F except that I can't be sure that the pivot columns are the first columns.
45:08
So the I and the F, could be partly mixed into the I.
45:14
Can I write that with just like that? So the F could be sort of partly into the I
45:23
if the first columns weren't the pivot columns. Now how many solutions in this case?
45:31
There's always a solution. This is the existence case. There's always a solution.
45:37
We're not getting any zero rows. There are no zero rows here. So there's always either one or infinitely many solutions.
45:45
OK.
45:53
Actually, I guess there's always an infinite number, because we always have some null space to deal with.
46:02
Then the final case is where r is smaller than m and smaller than n.
46:08
OK. Now that's the case where R is the identity
46:14
with some free stuff but with some zero rows too.
46:19
And that's the case where there's either no solution -- because we didn't get a zero equals zero for some bs,
46:29
or infinitely many solutions.
46:37
OK. Do you -- this board really summarizes the lecture,
46:44
and this sentence summarizes the lecture. The rank tells you everything about the number of solutions.
46:55
That number, the rank r, tells you all the information except the exact entries in the solutions.
47:01
For that you go to the matrix. OK, good. Have a great weekend, and I'll see you on Monday.
47:08
