OK, this is lecture twenty.
0:10
And this is the final lecture on determinants.
0:15
And it's about the applications. So we worked hard in the last two lectures
0:22
to get a formula for the determinant and the properties of the determinant.
0:27
Now to use the determinant and, and always this determinant
0:35
packs all this information into a single number.
0:40
And that number can give us formulas
0:45
for all sorts of, things that we've been calculating already without formulas.
0:51
Now what was A inverse? So, so I'm beginning with the formula for A inverse.
0:57
Two, two by two formula we know, right?
1:03
The two by two formula for A inverse, the inverse of a b c d
1:09
inverse is one over the determinant times d a -b -c.
1:22
Somehow I want to see what's going on for three by three
1:31
and n by n. And actually maybe you can see what's going on from this two
1:37
by two case. So there's a formula for the inverse, and what did I divide by?
1:44
The determinant. So what I'm looking for is a formula
1:50
where it has one over the determinant and, and you remember why that makes good sense,
1:56
because then that's perfect as long as the determinant isn't
2:02
zero, and that's exactly when there is an inverse. But now I have to ask can we recognize any of this stuff?
2:11
Do you recognize what that number d is from the past? From last, from the last lecture?
2:19
My hint is think cofactors. Because my formula is going to be, my formula for the inverse
2:28
is going to be one over the determinant times a matrix of cofactors.
2:33
So you remember that D? What's that the cofactor of? Remember cofactors?
2:39
If -- that's the one one cofactor, because if I strike out row and column one, I'm left with d.
2:47
And what's minus b? OK. Which cofactor is that one?
2:53
Oh, minus b is the cofactor of c, right?
3:00
If I strike out the c, I'm left with a b there. And why the minus sign?
3:07
Because this c was in a two one position, and two plus one is odd.
3:12
So there was a minus went into the cofactor, and that's it. OK. I'll write down next what my formula is.
3:21
Here's the big formula for the A -- for A inverse.
3:26
It's one over the determinant of A and then some matrix.
3:35
And that matrix is the matrix of cofactors, c.
3:41
Only one thing, it turns -- you'll see, I have to, I transpose.
3:47
So this is the matrix of cofactors, the -- what I'll just -- but why don't we just call it the cofactor matrix.
3:55
So the one one entry of, of c is the cof- is the one one
4:02
cofactor, the thing that we get by throwing away row and column one. It's the d.
4:09
And, because of the transpose, what I see up here
4:15
is the cofactor of this guy down here, right? That's where the transpose came in.
4:22
What I see here, this is the cofactor not of this one, because I've transposed.
4:28
This is the cofactor of the b. When I throw away the b, the b row and the b column,
4:35
I'm left with c, and then I have that minus sign again. And of course the two two entry is the cofactor
4:44
of d, and that's this a. So there's the formula.
4:49
OK. But we got to think why. I mean, it worked in this two by two case,
4:56
but a lot of other formulas would have worked just as well. We, we have to see why that's true.
5:02
In other words, why is it -- so this is what I aim to find.
5:09
And, and let's just sort of look to see what is that telling us. That tells us that the -- the expression for A inverse --
5:17
let's look at a three by three. Can I just write down a a b c d e f g h i?
5:27
And I'm looking for its inverse. And what kind of a formula -- do I see there?
5:33
I mean, what -- the determinant is a bunch of products of three factors,
5:38
right? The determinant of this matrix'll involve a e i, and b f times g, and c times d times h, and minus c
5:49
e g, and so on. So things with three factors go in here.
5:54
Things with how many factors do things in the cofactor matrix
6:03
have? What's a typical cofactor? What's the cofactor of a?
6:09
The cofactor of a, the one one entry up here in the inverse is?
6:14
I throw away the row and column containing a and I take the determinant of what's left,
6:19
that's the cofactor. And that's e i minus f h. Products of two things.
6:25
Now, I'm just making the observation that the determinant of A involves products of n entries.
6:36
And the cofactor matrix involves products of n minus 1 entries.
6:51
And, like, we never noticed any of this stuff
6:56
when we were computing the inverse by the Gauss-Jordan method or whatever. You remember how we did it?
7:02
We took the matrix A, we tucked the identity next to it, we did elimination till A became the identity.
7:10
And then that, the identity suddenly was A inverse. Well, that was great numerically.
7:16
But we never knew what was going on, basically. And now we see what the formula is
7:25
in terms of letters, what's the algebra instead of the algorithm. OK.
7:30
But I have to say why this is right, right? I still -- that's a pretty magic formula.
7:37
Where does it come from? Well, I'll just check it. Having, having got it up there, let me --
7:44
I'll say, how can we check -- what do I want to check?
7:50
I want to check that A times its inverse gives the identity. So I want, I want to check that A times this thing,
7:58
A times this -- now I'm going to write in the inverse -- gives the identity.
8:03
So I check that A times C transpose -- let me bring the determinant up here.
8:09
Determinant of A times the identity.
8:14
That's my job. That's it, that if this is true, and it is, then, then I've
8:24
correctly identified A inverse as C transpose divided by the determinant.
8:30
OK. But why is this true? Why is that true? Let me, let me put down what I'm doing here.
8:38
I have A -- here, here's A, here's a11 --
8:43
I'm doing this multiplication -- along to a1n. And then down in this last row will be an an1 along to ann.
8:53
And I'm multiplying by the cofactor matrix transposed.
8:59
So when I transpose, it'll be c11 c12 down to c1n.
9:07
Notice usually that one coming first would mean I'm in row one, but I've transposed,
9:15
so that's, those are the cofactors. This first column are the cofactors from row one.
9:21
And then the last column would be the cofactors from row n.
9:28
And why should that come out to be anything good?
9:33
In fact, why should it come out to be as good as this? Well, you can tell me what the one one entry in the product
9:43
is. This is like you're seeing the main point if you just tell me one entry.
9:49
What do I get up there in the one one entry when I do this row of this row from A times
10:00
this column of cofactors? What, what will I get there?
10:06
Because we have seen this. I mean, we're, right, building exactly on what the last lecture reached.
10:15
So this is a11 times c11, a12 times c12, a1n times c1n.
10:21
What does that what does that sum up to? That's the cofactor formula for the determinant.
10:32
That's the, this cofactor formula, which I wrote, which we got last time.
10:39
The determinant of A is, if I use row one, let, let I equal one, then I have a11 times
10:47
its cofactor, a12 times its cofactor, and so on. And that gives me the determinant.
10:54
And it worked in this, in this case. This row times this thing is, sure enough, ad minus bc.
11:06
But this formula says it always works. So up here in this, in this position,
11:12
I'm getting determinant of A. What about in the two two position?
11:18
Row two times column two there, what, what is that?
11:23
That's just the cofactors, that's just row two times its cofactors.
11:28
So of course I get the determinant again. And in the last here, this is the last row
11:36
times its cofactors. It's exactly -- you see, we're realizing that the cofactor
11:41
formula is just this sum of products, so of course we think, hey, we've got a matrix
11:47
multiplication there. And we get determinant of A.
11:57
But there's one more idea here, right? Great. What else, what have I not -- so I haven't got that formula
12:05
completely proved yet, because I've still got to do all
12:10
the off-diagonal stuff, which I want to be zero, right? I just want this to be determinant
12:17
of A times the identity, and then I'm, I'm a happy person.
12:22
So why should that be? Why should it be that one row times the cofactors
12:30
from a different row, which become a column because I transpose, give zero?
12:39
In other words, the cofactor formula gives the determinant if the row and the, and the cofactors -- you know,
12:48
if the entries of A and the cofactors are for the same row.
12:54
But for some reason, if I take the cofactors from the -- entries from the first row and the cofactors from the second
13:01
row, for some reason I automatically get zero. And it's sort of like interesting
13:08
to say, why does that happen? And can I just check that -- of course, we know it happens,
13:14
in this case. Here are the numbers from row one and here are the cofactors from row two, right?
13:24
Those are the numbers in row one. And th- these are the cofactors from row two, because the cofactor of c is minus b
13:32
and the cofactor of d is a. And sure enough, that row times this column gives --
13:40
please say it. Zero, right. OK. So now how come?
13:47
How come? Can we even see it in this two by two case? Why did -- well, I mean, I guess we, you know,
13:54
in one way we certainly do see it, because it's right here. I mean, do we just do it, and then we get zero. But we want to think of some reason
14:01
why the answer's zero, some reason that we can use in the n
14:07
by n case. So let -- here, here is my thinking.
14:13
We must be, if we're getting the answer's zero, we suspect that what we're doing somehow,
14:20
we're taking the determinant of some matrix that has two equal rows.
14:26
So I believe that if we multiply these by the cofactors from some other row, we're taking the determinant -- ye,
14:35
what matrix are we taking the determinant of? Here it's, this is it. We're, when we do that times this, we're really taking --
14:44
can I put this in little letters down here? I'm taking -- let me look at the matrix a b a b.
14:57
Let me call that matrix AS, A screwed up.
15:03
OK. All right. So now that matrix is certainly singular.
15:09
So if we find its determinant, we're going to get zero. But I claim that if we find its determinant by the cofactor
15:16
rule, go along the first row, we would take a times the cofactor of a.
15:23
And what is the -- see, how -- oh no -- let me go along the second row.
15:32
OK. So let's see, which -- if I take -- I know I've got a singular matrix here.
15:40
And I believe that when I do this multiplication, what
15:46
I'm doing is using the cofactor formula for the determinant. And I know I'm going to get zero.
15:52
Let me try this again. So the cofactor formula for the determinant says I should take a times its cofactor, which is this b,
16:04
plus b times its cofactor, which is this minus a.
16:09
OK. That's what we're doing, apart from a sign here.
16:15
Oh yeah, so you know, there might be a minus multiplying
16:20
everything. So if I take this determinant, it's A -- the determinant of this, the determinant of A screwed up is
16:29
a times its cofactor, which is b, plus the second guy times its cofactor, which is minus a.
16:38
And of course I get the answer zero, and this is exactly what's happening in that, in that,
16:45
row times this wrong column. OK.
16:52
That's the two by two picture, and it's just the same here. That the reason I get a zero up in there is, the reason
17:01
I get a zero is that when I multiply the first row of A
17:09
and the last row of the cofactor matrix, it's as if I'm taking the determinant of this screwed up
17:16
matrix that has first and last rows identical.
17:22
The book pins this down more specific -- and more carefully than I can do in the lecture.
17:29
I hope you're seeing the point. That this is an identity. That it's a beautiful identity and it tells us what
17:37
the inverse of the matrix is. So it gives us the inverse, the formula for the inverse.
17:43
OK. So that's the first goal of my lecture, was to find this
17:49
formula. It's done. OK. And of course I could invert, now, I can,
17:58
I sort of like I can see what -- I can answer questions like this. Suppose I have a matrix, and let me move the one one
18:08
entry. What happens to the inverse?
18:13
Just, just think about that question. Suppose I have some matrix, I just write down some nice, non-singular matrix that's got an inverse,
18:21
and then I move the one one entry a little bit. I add one to it, for example.
18:27
What happens to the inverse matrix? Well, this formula should tell me.
18:33
I have to look to see what happens to the determinant and what happens to all the cofactors.
18:39
And, the picture, it's all there. It's all there.
18:44
We can really understand how the inverse changes when the matrix changes.
18:51
OK. Now my second application is to -- let me put that over here --
18:58
is to Ax=b. Well, the -- course, the solution is A inverse b.
19:09
But now I have a formula for A inverse. A inverse is one over the determinant
19:17
times this C transpose times B. I now know what A inverse is.
19:24
So now I just have to say, what have I got here? Is there any way to, to make this formula, this answer,
19:33
which is the one and only answer -- it's the very same answer we got on the first day of the class
19:40
by elimination. Now I'm -- now I've got a formula for the answer.
19:47
Can I play with it further to see what's going on? And Cramer's, this Cramer's Rule is exactly, that --
20:01
a way of looking at this formula.
20:07
OK. So this is a formula for x. Here's my formula.
20:13
Well, of course. The first thing I see from the formula is that the answer x always has that in the determinant.
20:21
I'm not surprised. There's a division by the determinant. But then I have to say a little more carefully what's going on
20:29
And let me tell you what Cramer's Rule is. up here. Let, let me take x1, the first component.
20:35
So this is the first component of the answer. Then there'll be a second component and a,
20:40
all the other components. Can I take just the first component of this formula?
20:46
Well, I certainly have determinant of A down under.
20:52
And what the heck is the first -- so what do I get in C transpose b?
21:00
What's the first entry of C transpose b? That's what I have to answer myself.
21:06
Well, what's the first entry of C transpose b?
21:13
This B is -- let me tell you what it is. OK. Somehow I'm multiplying cofactors
21:22
by the entries of B, right, in this product. Cofactors from the matrix times entries of b.
21:30
So any time I'm multiplying cofactors by numbers, I think, I'm getting the determinant of something.
21:36
And let me call that something B1. So this is a matrix, the matrix whose determinant is coming out
21:46
of that. And we'll, we'll see what it is. x2 will be the determinant of some other matrix B2, also
21:54
divided by determinant of A. So now I just -- Cramer just had a good idea.
22:00
He realized what matrix it was, what these B1 and B2 and B3
22:06
and so on matrices were. Let me write them on the board underneath.
22:14
OK. So what is this B1? This B1 is the matrix that has b in its first column
22:24
and otherwise the rest of it is A. So it otherwise it has the rest, the, the n-1 columns of A.
22:38
It's the matrix with -- it's just the matrix A with column one replaced
22:51
by the right-hand side, by the right-hand side b.
22:58
Because somehow when I take the determinant of this guy,
23:04
it's giving me this matrix multiplication. Well, how could that be?
23:10
How could -- so what's, what's the determinant formula
23:16
I'll use here? I'll use cofactors, of course.
23:21
And I might as well use cofactors down column one. So when I use cofactors down column one,
23:27
I'm taking the first entry of b times what? Times the cofactor c11.
23:35
Do you see that? When I, when I use cofactors here,
23:40
I take the first entry here, B one let's call it, times the cofactor there.
23:47
But what's the cofactor in -- my little hand-waving is meant to indicate that it's a matrix of one size smaller,
23:54
the cofactor. And it's exactly c11. Well, that's just what we wanted.
24:01
This first entry is c11 times b1.
24:06
And then the next entry is whatever, is c21 times b2,
24:13
and so on. And sure enough, if I look here, when I'm, when I do the cofactor expansion,
24:19
b2 is getting multiplied by the right thing, and so on.
24:25
So there's Cramer's Rule. And the book gives another kind of cute proof
24:31
without, without building so much on, on cofactors.
24:36
But here we've got cofactors, so I thought I'd just give you this proof. So what is B --
24:42
in general, what is Bj? This is the, this is A with column j replaced by, by b.
24:58
So that's -- the determinant of that matrix that you divide
25:08
by determinant of A to get xj. So x -- let me change this general formula.
25:14
xj, the j-th one, is the determinant of Bj divided by the determinant of A.
25:22
And now we've said what Bj is.
25:30
Well, so Cramer found a rule. And we could ask him, OK, great, good work, Cramer.
25:39
But is your rule any good in practice? So he says, well, you couldn't ask about a rule in mine,
25:49
right, because it's just -- all you have to do is find the determinant of A and these
25:56
other determinants, so I guess -- oh, he just says, well, all you have to do is find n+1 determinants,
26:04
the, the n Bs and the A. And actually, I remember reading -- there was a book,
26:17
popular book that, that kids interested in math read when I was a kid interested in math called Mathematics
26:25
for the Million or something, by a guy named Bell. And it had a little page about linear algebra.
26:34
And it said,-- so it explained elimination in a very complicated way.
26:41
I certainly didn't understand it. And, and it made it, you know, it sort of said, well,
26:47
there is this formula for elimination, but look at this great formula, Cramer's Rule.
26:55
So it certainly said Cramer's Rule was the way to go. But actually, Cramer's Rule is a disastrous way to go,
27:05
because to compute these determinants, it takes, like, approximately forever.
27:12
So actually I now think of that book title as being Mathematics for the Millionaire,
27:18
because you'd have to be able to pay for, a hopelessly long calculation where elimination, of course,
27:26
produced the x-s, in an instant. But having a formula allows you to, with, with letters, you
27:36
know, allows you to do algebra instead of, algorithms. So the, there's some value in the Cramer's Rule formula
27:44
for x and in the explicit formula for, for A inverse.
27:52
They're nice formulas, but I just don't want you to use them.
27:57
That'ss what it comes to. If you had to -- and Matlab would never, never do it.
28:02
I mean, it would use elimination. OK. Now I'm ready for number three in today's list
28:11
of amazing connections coming through the determinant.
28:17
And that number three is the fact that the determinant gives a volume.
28:22
OK. So now -- so that's my final topic for --
28:28
among these -- this my number three application, that the determinant is actually equals the volume of something.
28:37
Can I use this little space to consider a special case,
28:42
and then I'll use the far board to think about the general rule.
28:47
So what I going to prove? Or claim. I claim that the determinant of the matrix
28:56
is the volume of a box.
29:02
OK, and you say, which box? Fair enough. OK.
29:08
So let's see. I'm in -- shall we say we're in, say three by three?
29:16
Shall we suppose -- let's, let's say three by three. So, so we can really -- we're, we're talking about boxes
29:22
in three dimensions, and three by three matrices. And so all I do -- you could guess what the box is.
29:30
Here is, here is, three dimensions. OK. Now I take the first row of the matrix, a11, a22, A --
29:41
sorry. a11, a12, a13. That row is a vector.
29:48
It goes to some point. That point will be -- and that edge going to it,
29:53
will be an edge of the box, and that point will be a corner of the box. So here is zero zero zero, of course.
30:01
And here's the first row of the matrix: a11, a12, a13.
30:09
So that's one edge of the box.
30:14
Another edge of the box is to the second row of the matrix, row two.
30:21
Can I just call it there row two? And a third row of the box will be to --
30:28
a third row -- a third edge of the box will be given by row three. So, so there's row three.
30:36
That, the coordinates, what are the coordinates of that corner of the box? a31, a32, a33.
30:47
So I've got that edge of the box, that edge of the box, that edge of the box, and that's all I need.
30:53
Now I just finish out the box, right?
30:59
I just -- the proper word, of course, is parallelepiped. But for obvious reasons, I wrote box.
31:08
OK. So, OK. So there's the, there's the bottom of the box.
31:14
There're the four edge sides of the box.
31:19
There's the top of the box. Cute, right? It's the box that has these three edges
31:28
and then it's completed to a, to a, each, you know, each side is a, is a parallelogram.
31:35
And it's that box whose volume is given by the determinant.
31:43
That's -- now it's -- possible that the determinant is
31:50
negative. So we have to just say what's going on in that case.
31:56
If the determinant is negative, then the volume, we,
32:01
we should take the absolute value really. So the volume, if we, if we think of volume as positive,
32:07
we should take the absolute value of the determinant. But the, the sign, what does the sign of the determinant --
32:14
it always must tell us something. And somehow it, it will tell us whether these three is a --
32:20
whether it's a right-handed box or a left-handed box. If we, if we reversed two of the edges,
32:30
we would go between a right-handed box and a left-handed box. We wouldn't change the volume, but we would
32:35
change the, the cyclic, order.
32:40
So I won't worry about that. And, so one special case is what?
32:47
A equal identity matrix. So let's take that special case.
32:52
A equal identity matrix. Is the formula determinant of identity matrix,
32:59
does that equal the volume of the box? Well, what is the box?
33:06
What's the box? If A is the identity matrix, then these three rows are
33:12
the three coordinate vectors, and the box is --
33:17
it's a cube. It's the unit cube. So if, if A is the identity matrix, of course
33:23
our formula is Well, actually that proves property one --
33:29
that the volume right. has property one. Actually, we could, we could, we could get this thing if we --
33:35
if we can show that the box volume has the same three properties that define the determinant,
33:42
then it must be the determinant. So that's like the, the, the elegant way to prove this.
33:51
To prove this amazing fact that the determinant equals the volume, first we'll check it for the identity matrix.
33:58
That's fine. The box is a cube and its volume is one and the determinant is one and, and one agrees with one.
34:07
Now let me take one -- let me go up one level to an orthogonal matrix.
34:12
Because I'd like to take this chance to bring in chapter -- the, the previous chapter.
34:18
Suppose I have an orthogonal matrix. What did that mean? I always called those things Q.
34:25
What was the point of -- suppose I have, suppose instead of the identity matrix I'm now going to take A
34:32
equal Q, an orthogonal matrix.
34:42
What was Q then? That was a matrix whose columns were orthonormal, right?
34:52
Those were its columns were unit vectors, perpendicular unit vectors.
34:59
So what kind of a box have we got now? What kind of a box comes from the rows or the columns,
35:06
I don't mind, because the determinant is the determinant of the transpose, so I'm never worried about
35:11
that. What kind of a box, what shape box have we got if the matrix is an orthogonal matrix?
35:20
It's another cube. It's a cube again. How is it different from the identity cube?
35:27
It's just rotated.
35:33
It's just the orthogonal matrix Q doesn't have to be the identity matrix.
35:38
It's just the unit cube but turned in space. So sure enough, it's the unit cube, and its volume is one.
35:48
Now is the determinant one? What's the determinant of Q?
35:55
We believe that the determinant of Q better be one or minus one, so that our formula is -- checks out in that --
36:03
if we can't check it in these easy cases where we got a cube, we're not going to get it in the general case.
36:11
So why is the determinant of Q equal one or minus one?
36:18
What do we know about Q? What's the one matrix statement of the properties of Q?
36:25
A matrix with orthonormal columns has -- satisfies a certain equation.
36:31
What, what is that? It's if we have this orthogonal matrix, then the fact --
36:38
the way to say what it, what its properties are is this.
36:45
Q prime, u- u- Q transpose Q equals I.
36:50
Right? That's what -- those are the matrices that get the name Q,
36:57
the matrices that Q transpose Q is I. OK. Now from that, tell me why is the determinant one
37:07
or minus one. How do I, out of this fact --
37:12
this may even be a homework problem. It's there in the, in the list of exercises in the book,
37:20
and let's just do it. How do I get, how do I discover that the determinant of Q
37:27
is one or maybe minus one? I take determinants of both sides, everybody says,
37:34
so I won't -- I take determinants of both sides. On the right-hand side -- so I, when I take determinants
37:41
of both sides, let me just do it. Take the determinant of -- take determinants.
37:48
Determinant of the identity is one.
37:53
What's the determinant of that product? Rule nine is paying off now.
38:02
The determinant of a product is the determinant of this guy --
38:07
maybe I'll put it, I'll use that symbol for determinant. It's the determinant of that guy times the determinant
38:14
of the other guy. And then what's the determinant of Q transpose?
38:21
It's the same as the determinant of Q. Rule ten pays off. So this is just this thing squared.
38:28
So that determinant squared is one and sure enough it's one
38:33
or minus one. Great. So in these special cases of cubes,
38:42
we really do have determinant equals volume.
38:48
Now can I just push that to non-cubes.
38:54
Let me push it first to rectangles, rectangular boxes,
39:02
where I'm just multiplying the e- the edges are -- let me keep all the ninety degree angles,
39:10
because those are -- that, that makes my life easy. And just stretch the edges.
39:16
Suppose I stretch that first edge, suppose this first edge I double.
39:23
Suppose I double that first edge, keeping the other edges the same.
39:31
What happens to the volume? It doubles, right?
39:36
We know that the volume of a cube doubles. In fact, because we know that the new cube would sit right
39:42
on top -- I mean, the new, the added cube would sit right on -- would fit --
39:47
probably a geometer would say congruent or something -- would go right in, in the other. We'd have two.
39:52
We have two identical cubes. Total volume is now two.
39:58
OK. So I want -- if I double an edge, the volume doubles. What happens to the determinant?
40:03
If I double, the first row of a matrix, what ch-
40:14
ch- what's the effect on the determinant? It also doubles, right?
40:21
And that was rule number 3a. Remember rule 3a was that if I, I could,
40:29
if I had a factor in, in row one, T, I could factor it out.
40:36
So if, if I have a factor two in that row one, I can factor it out of the determinant.
40:43
It agrees with the -- the volume of the box has that factor two.
40:48
So, so volume satisfies this property 3a. And now I really close, but I -- but to get to the very end
40:59
of this proof, I have to get away from right angles. I have to allow the possibility of, other angles.
41:10
And -- or what's saying the same thing, I have to check that the volume also satisfies 3b.
41:18
So can I -- This is end of proof that the -- so I'm --
41:24
determinant of A equals volume of box, and where I right now?
41:34
This volume has properties, properties one, no problem.
41:40
If the box is the cube, everything is -- if the box is the unit cube, its volume is one.
41:49
Property two was if I reverse two rows,
41:54
but that doesn't change the box. And it doesn't change the absolute value, so no problem
42:00
there. Property 3a was if I mul- you remember what 3a was?
42:06
So property one was about the identity matrix. Property two was about a plus or minus sign
42:12
that I don't care about. Property 3a was a factor T in a row.
42:18
But now I've got property three B to deal with.
42:24
What was property 3b? This is a great way to review these, properties.
42:30
So that 3b, the property 3b said -- let's do, let's do two by two.
42:36
So said that if I had a+a', b+b', c,
42:42
d that this equaled what? So this is property 3b.
42:49
This is the linearity in row one by itself. So c d is staying the same, and I can split this into a b
42:59
and a' b'.
43:06
That's property 3b, at least in the two by two case.
43:12
And what I -- I wanted now to show that the volume, which
43:20
two, two by two, that means area, has this, has this property.
43:25
Let me just emphasize that we have got -- we're getting --
43:32
this is a formula, then, for the area of a parallelogram. The area of this parallelogram -- can I just draw it?
43:40
OK, here's the, here's the parallelogram. I have the row a b.
43:45
That's the first row. That's the point a b. And I tack on c d.
43:54
c d, coming out of here. And I complete the parallelogram.
43:59
So this is -- well, I better make it look right.
44:08
It's really this one that has coordinates c d and this has coordinates -- well, whatever the sum is.
44:17
And of course starting at zero zero.
44:22
So we all know, this is a+c, b+d.
44:29
Rather than -- I'm pausing on that proof for a minute just to going back to our formula.
44:37
Because I want you to see that unlike Cramer's Rule, that I wasn't that impressed by, I'm
44:44
very impressed by this formula for the area of a parallelogram. And what's our formula?
44:50
What, what's the area of that parallelogram? If I had asked you that last year,
45:00
you would have said OK, the area of a parallelogram is the base times the height,
45:06
right? So you would have figured out what this base, the -- how long that base was.
45:12
It's like the square root of A squared plus b squared. And then you would have figured out how much is this height, whatever it is.
45:20
It's horrible. This, I mean, we got square roots, and in that height
45:28
there would be other revolting stuff. But now what's the formula that we now know for the area?
45:35
45:42
It's the determinant of our little matrix.
45:48
It's just ad-bc.
45:56
No square roots. Totally rememberable, because it's exactly a formula
46:03
that we've been studying the whole, for three lectures. OK.
46:11
That's, you know, that's the most important point I'm making here. Is that if you know the coordinates of a box,
46:20
of the corners, then you have a great formula for the volume, area or volume, that
46:28
doesn't involve any lengths or any angles or any heights, but just involves the coordinates that you've got.
46:37
And similarly, what's the area of this triangle? Suppose I chop that off and say what about --
46:43
because you might often be interested in a triangle instead of a parallelogram. What's the area of this triangle?
46:48
Now there again, everybody would have
46:53
said the area of a triangle is half the base times the height.
47:01
And in some cases, if you know the base that a, that's -- and the height, that's fine.
47:06
But here, we, what we know is the coordinates of the corners. We know the vertices.
47:11
And so what's the area of that triangle?
47:17
If I know these, if I know a b, c d, and zero zero, what's the area?
47:25
It's just half, so it's just half of this. So this is, this is a- a b -- a d -
47:33
b c for the parallelogram and one half of that,
47:38
one half of ad-bc for the triangle.
47:47
So I mean, this is a totally trivial remark, to say, well, divide by two.
47:52
But it's just that you more often see triangles, and you feel you know the formula for the area
48:01
but the good formula for the area is this one. And I'm just going to --
48:06
I'm just going to say one more thing about the area of a triangle. It's just because it's -- you know, it's so great to have a good formula for something.
48:15
What if our triangle did not start at zero zero?
48:20
What if our triangle, what if we had this -- what if we had -- so I'm coming back to triangles again.
48:28
But let me, let me put this triangle somewhere, it's --
48:40
I'm staying with triangles, I'm just in two dimensions, but I'm going to allow you to give me any three corners.
48:53
And in -- those six numbers must determine the area.
49:01
And what's the formula? The area is going to be, it's going to be, there'll be that half of a parallelogram.
49:09
I mean, basically this can't be completely new, right? We've got the area when -- we, we know the area when this is
49:17
zero zero. Now we just want to lift our sight slightly and get the area
49:24
when all th- so let me write down what it, what it comes out to be. It turns out that if you do this, x1 y1 and a 1, x2 y2
49:37
and a 1, x3 y3 and a 1, that that works.
49:44
That the determinant symbol, of course. It's just -- if I gave you that determinant to find,
49:51
you might subtract this row from this. It would kill that one. Subtract this row from this, it would kill that one.
49:59
Then you'd have a simple determinant to do with differences, and it would --
50:06
this little subtraction, what I did was equivalent to moving the triangle
50:12
to start at the origin. I did it fast, because time is up.
50:19
And I didn't complete that proof of 3b. I'll leave -- the book has a carefully drawn figure to show
50:28
why that works. But I hope you saw the main point is
50:34
that for area and volume, determinant gives a great formula.
50:39
OK. And next lectures are about eigenvalues, so we're really into the big stuff.
50:47
Thanks.
