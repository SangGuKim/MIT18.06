0:10
OK, guys the -- we're almost ready to make this lecture
0:17
immortal. OK. Are we on?
0:22
All right. This is an important lecture. It's about projections.
0:30
Let me start by just projecting a vector b down on a vector a.
0:36
So just to so you see what the geometry looks like in when I'm in -- in just two dimensions,
0:44
I'd like to find the point along this line so that line through
0:51
a is a one-dimensional subspace, so I'm starting with one dimension. I'd like to find the point on that line closest to a.
1:00
Can I just take that problem first and then I'll explain why I want to do it and why I want
1:06
to project on other subspaces. So where's the point closest to b that's on that line?
1:14
It's somewhere there. And let me connect that and -- and what's the whole point
1:24
of my picture now? What's the -- where does orthogonality come into this picture?
1:30
The whole point is that this best point, that's the projection, P, of b onto the line, where's orthogonality?
1:44
It's the fact that that's a right angle. That this -- the error -- this is like how much I'm wrong
1:50
by -- this is the difference between b and P, the whole point is --
1:57
that's perpendicular to a. That's got to give us the equation.
2:03
That's got to tell us -- that's the one fact we know, that's got to tell us where that projection is.
2:11
Let me also say, look -- I've drawn a triangle there.
2:16
So if we were doing trigonometry we would do like we would have angles theta and distances that
2:25
would involve sine theta and cos theta that leads to lousy formulas compared to linear algebra.
2:33
The formula that we want comes out nicely and what's the --
2:40
what do we know? We know that P, this projection, is some multiple of a, right?
2:49
It's on that line. So we know it's in that one-dimensional subspace, it's
2:54
some multiple, let me call that multiple x, of a. So really it's that number x I'd like to find.
3:03
So this is going to be simple in 1-D, so let's just carry it through, and then see
3:11
how it goes in high dimensions. OK. The key fact is --
3:17
the key to everything is that perpendicular. The fact that a is perpendicular to a is perpendicular to e.
3:31
Which is (b-ax), xa. I don't care what --
3:36
xa. That that equals zero.
3:41
Do you see that as the central equation, that's saying that this a is perpendicular to this --
3:50
correction, that's going to tell us what x is. Let me just raise the board and simplify that and out will
3:57
come x. OK. So if I simplify that, let's see, I'll move one to --
4:06
one term to one side, the other term will be on the other side, it looks to me like x times a transpose a
4:14
is equal to a transpose b.
4:21
Right? I have a transpose b as one f- one term, a transpose a as the other, so right
4:27
away here's my a transpose a. But it's just a number now.
4:32
And I divide by it. And I get the answer. x is a transpose b over a transpose a.
4:42
And P, the projection I wanted, is --
4:48
that's the right multiple. That's got a cosine theta built in. But we don't need to look at angles.
4:55
It's -- we've just got vectors here. And the projection is P is a times that x.
5:02
5:07
Or x times that a. But I'm really going to -- eventually I'm going to want that x coming on the right-hand side.
5:13
So do you see that I've got two of the three formulas already,
5:20
right here, I've got the -- that's the equation -- that leads me to the answer,
5:29
here's the answer for x, and here's the projection.
5:34
OK. can I do add just one more thing to this one-dimensional problem?
5:39
One more like lift it up into linear algebra, into matrices.
5:45
Here's the last thing I want to do --
5:50
but don't forget those formulas. a transpose b over a transpose a.
5:55
Actually let's look at that for a moment first.
6:06
Suppose -- Let me take this next step. So P is a times x.
6:11
So can I write that then? P is a times this neat number, a transpose b over a transpose a.
6:20
That's our projection.
6:26
Can I ask a couple of questions about it, just while we look, get that digest that formula.
6:32
Suppose b is doubled. Suppose I change b to two b.
6:41
What happens to the projection? So suppose I instead of that vector b that I drew
6:48
on the board make it two b, twice as long -- what's the projection now?
6:55
It's doubled too, right? It's going to be twice as far, if b goes twice as far,
7:01
the projection will go twice as far. And you see it there. If I put in an extra factor two, then P's got that factor
7:09
too. Now what about if I double a? What if I double the vector a that I'm projecting onto?
7:19
What changes? The projection doesn't change at all.
7:25
Right? Because I'm just -- the line didn't change. If I double a or I take minus a.
7:31
It's still that same line. The projection's still in the same place. And of course if I double a I get a four up above,
7:40
and I get a four -- an extra four below, they cancel out, and the projection is the same.
7:45
OK. So really, this -- I want to look at this as the projection --
7:54
there's a matrix here. The projection is carried out by some matrix
8:01
that I'm going to call the projection matrix. And in other words the projection
8:07
is some matrix that acts on this guy b and produces the projection.
8:14
The projection P is the projection matrix acting
8:21
on whatever the input is. The input is b, the projection matrix is P. OK.
8:28
Actually you can tell me right away what this projection matrix is. So this is a pretty interesting matrix.
8:37
What matrix is multiplying b? I'm just -- just from my formula --
8:42
I see what P is. P, this projection matrix, is --
8:51
what is it? I see a a transpose above, and I see a transpose a below.
8:59
And those don't cancel.
9:04
That's not one. Right? That's a matrix. Because down here, the a transpose a,
9:10
that's just a number, a transpose a, that's the length of a squared, and up above is a column times
9:18
a row. Column times a row is a matrix. So this is a full-scale n by n matrix, if I --
9:26
if I'm in n dimensions. And it's kind of an interesting one.
9:32
And it's the one which if I multiply by b then I get this, you see once again I'm putting parentheses
9:39
in different places. I'm putting the parentheses right there.
9:46
I'm saying OK, that's really the matrix that produces this projection.
9:55
OK. Now, tell me -- all right, what are the properties of that matrix?
10:02
I'm just using letters here, a and b, I could put in numbers,
10:08
but I think it's -- for once, it's clearer with letters, because all formulas are simple, a transpose b over a transpose
10:16
a -- that's the number that multiplies the a, and then I see wait a minute, there's a matrix here and what's the rank
10:26
of that matrix, by the way? What's the rank of that matrix, yeah --
10:31
let me just ask you about that matrix. Which looks a little strange, a a transpose over this number.
10:38
But well, I could ask you its column space.
10:46
Yeah, let me ask you its column space. So what's the column space of a matrix?
10:52
If you multiply that matrix by anything you always get in the column space, right?
10:59
The column space of a matrix is when you multiply any vector
11:04
by that matrix -- any vector b, by the matrix, you always land in the column space.
11:13
That's what column spaces work. Now what space do we always land in?
11:20
What's the column space of -- what's the result when I multiply this any vector
11:26
b by my matrix? So I have P times b, where I?
11:34
I'm on that line, right? The column space, so here are facts about this matrix.
11:40
The column space of P, of this projection matrix,
11:46
is the line through a.
11:52
And the rank of this matrix is you can all say it at once one.
12:03
Right. The rank is one. This is a rank one matrix. Actually it's exactly the form that we're
12:10
familiar with a rank one matrix. A column times a row, that's a rank one matrix, that column
12:20
is the basis for the column space.
12:27
Just one dimension. OK. So I know that much about the matrix.
12:32
But now there are two more facts about the matrix that I want to notice.
12:40
First of all is the matrix symmetric? That's a natural question for matrices.
12:45
And the answer is yes. If I take the transpose of this -- there's a number down there,
12:52
the transpose of a a transpose is a a transpose. So P is symmetric.
12:59
P transpose equals P. So this is a key property.
13:04
That the projection matrix is symmetric. One more property now and this is the real one.
13:12
What happens if I do the projection twice?
13:18
So I'm looking for something, some information about P squared.
13:24
But just give me in terms of that picture, in terms my picture, I take any vector b, I multiply it
13:33
by my projection matrix, and that puts me there, so this is Pb.
13:41
And now I project again. What happens now?
13:46
What happens when I apply the projection matrix a second time?
13:51
To this, so I'm applying it once brings me here and the second time brings me I stay put.
14:01
Right? The projection for a point on this line the projection is right where it is.
14:08
The projection is the same point. So that means that if I project twice,
14:16
I get the same answer as I did in the first projection.
14:21
So those are the two properties that
14:26
tell me I'm looking at a projection matrix. It's symmetric and it's square is itself.
14:35
Because if I project a second time, it's the same result as the first result.
14:40
OK. So that's -- and then here's the exact formula when I know what
14:49
I'm projecting onto, that line through a, then I know what P is.
14:54
So do you see that I have all the pieces here for projection on a line?
14:59
Now, and those -- please remember those. So there are three formulas to remember.
15:07
The formula for x, the formula for P, which is just ax, and then the formula for capital P, which is the matrix.
15:17
Good. Good. OK. Now I want to move to more dimensions.
15:26
So we're going to have three formulas again but you'll have to --
15:32
they'll be a little different because we won't have a single line but -- a plane or three-dimensional
15:40
or a n-dimensional subspace. OK. So now I'll move to the next question.
15:49
Maybe -- let me say first why I want this projection,
16:04
and then we'll figure out what it is, we'll go completely in parallel there, and then we'll use it.
16:11
OK, why do I want this projection? Well, so why project?
16:17
It's because I'm as I mentioned last time this new chapter
16:32
deals with equations Ax=b may have no solution.
16:47
16:54
So that's really my problem, that I'm given a bunch of equations probably too
17:00
many equations, more equations than unknowns, and I can't solve them.
17:08
OK. So what do I do? I solve the closest problem that I can solve.
17:15
And what's the closest one? Well, ax will always be in the column space of a.
17:21
That's my problem. My problem is ax has to be in the column space
17:27
and b is probably not in the column space. So I change b to what?
17:36
I choose the closest vector in the column space, so I'll solve Ax equal P instead.
17:50
That one I can do. Where P is this is the projection
17:57
of b onto the column space.
18:04
That's why I want to be able to do this. Because I have to find a solution here,
18:10
and I'm going to put a little hat there to indicate that it's not the x, it's
18:17
not the x that doesn't exist, it's the x hat that's best possible.
18:27
So I must be able to figure out what's
18:32
the good projection there. What's the good right-hand side that is in the column space
18:38
that's as close as possible to b and then I'm -- then I know what to do.
18:43
OK. So now I've got that problem. So that's why I have the problem again
18:50
but now let me say I'm in three dimensions, so I have a plane maybe for example,
18:58
and I have a vector b that's not in the plane.
19:06
And I want to project b down into the plane.
19:13
OK. So there's my question. How do I project a vector and I'm --
19:19
what I'm looking for is a nice formula, and I'm counting on linear algebra to just come out right,
19:28
a nice formula for the projection of b into the plane.
19:34
The nearest point. So this again a right angle is going to be crucial.
19:41
OK. Now so what's -- first of all I've got to say what is that plane.
19:48
To get a formula I have to tell you what the plane is. How I going to tell you a plane?
19:53
I'll tell you a basis for the plane, I'll tell you two vectors a one and a two that give you a basis
20:03
for the plane, so that -- let us say -- say there's an a one and here's an a -- a vector a two.
20:12
They don't have to be perpendicular. But they better be independent, because then that tells me the
20:18
plane. The plane is the -- is the plane of a one and a two.
20:24
20:31
And actually going back to my -- to this connection, this plane is a column space,
20:39
it's the column space of what matrix?
20:47
What matrix, so how do I connect the two questions?
20:56
I'm thinking how do I project onto a plane and I want to get a matrix in here.
21:06
Everything's cleaner if I write it in terms of a matrix. So what matrix has these -- has that column space?
21:14
Well of course it's just the matrix that has a one in the first column
21:20
and a two in the second column. Right, just just let's be sure we've got the question
21:27
before we get to the answer. So I'm looking for again I'm given
21:34
a matrix a with two columns. And really I'm ready once I get to two I'm ready for n.
21:44
So it could be two columns, it could be n columns. I'll write the answer in terms of the matrix a.
21:50
And the point will be those two columns describe the plane,
21:56
they describe the column space, and I want to project. OK.
22:01
And I'm given a vector b that's probably not in the column space. Of course, if b is in the column space, my projection is simple,
22:11
it's just b. But most likely I have an error e, this b minus P
22:19
part, which is probably not zero. OK.
22:25
But the beauty is that I know -- from geometry or I could get it from calculus or I could get it
22:35
from linear algebra that that this this vector --
22:42
this is the part of b that's that's perpendicular to the plane.
22:48
That e is perpendicular is perpendicular to the plane.
22:55
If your intuition is saying that that's the crucial fact.
23:03
That's going to give us the answer. OK. So let me, that's the problem.
23:10
Now for the answer. So this is a lecture that's really like moving along.
23:18
Because I'm just plotting that problem up there and asking you
23:24
what combination -- now, yeah, so what is it? What is this projection P?
23:31
P. This is projection P, is some multiple of these basis
23:42
guys, right, some multiple of the columns. But I don't like writing out x one a one plus x two a two,
23:51
I would rather right that as ax.
23:56
Well, actually I should put if I'm really doing everything right, I should put a little hat on it --
24:02
to remember that this x -- that those are the numbers and I could have a put
24:08
a hat way back there is right, so this
24:14
is this is the projection, P. P is ax bar.
24:20
And I'm looking for x bar. So that's what I want an equation for.
24:28
So now I've got hold of the problem. The problem is find the right combination of the columns
24:36
so that the error vector is perpendicular to the plane.
24:44
Now let me turn that into an equation. So I'll raise the board and just turn that --
24:53
what we've just done into an equation.
24:58
So let me I'll write again the main point. The projection is ax b- x hat.
25:06
And our problem is find x hat.
25:12
And the key is that b minus ax hat, that's the error.
25:23
This is the e. Is perpendicular to the plane.
25:30
That's got to give me well what I looking
25:38
for, I'm looking for two equations now because I've got an x one and an x two.
25:45
And I'll get two equations because so this thing e is perpendicular to the plane.
25:51
So what does that mean? I guess it means it's perpendicular to a one
26:00
and also to a two. Right, those are two vectors in the plane and the things
26:06
that are perpendicular to the plane are perpendicular to a one and a two. Let me just repeat.
26:12
This this guy then is perpendicular to the plane so it's perpendicular to that vector and that vector.
26:18
Not -- it's perpendicular to that of course. But it's perpendicular to everything I the plane.
26:25
And the plane is really told me by a one and a two.
26:31
So really I have the equations a one transpose b minus ax
26:39
is zero. And also a two transpose b minus ax is zero.
26:48
Those are my two equations.
26:53
But I want those in matrix form.
27:02
I want to put those two equations together as a matrix equation and it's just comes out right.
27:08
Look at the matrix a transpose. Put a one a one transpose is its first row,
27:16
a two transpose is its second row, that multiplies this b-ax,
27:25
and gives me the zero and the zero. I'm you see the --
27:39
this is one way -- to come up with this equation. So the equation I'm coming up with
27:44
is a transpose b-ax hat is zero.
27:52
OK. That's my equation.
27:59
All right. Now I want to stop for a moment before I solve it and just think about it.
28:06
First of all do you see that that equation back in the very
28:13
first problem I solved on a line, what was -- what was on a line the matrix a only had one column,
28:23
it was just little a. So in the first problem I solved,
28:29
projecting on a line, this for capital a you just change that to little a
28:35
and you have the same equation that we solved before. a transpose e equals zero.
28:42
OK. Now a second thing, second comment.
28:48
I would like to since I know about these four subspaces,
28:54
I would like to get them into this picture.
29:00
So let me ask the question, what subspace is this thing in?
29:07
Which of the four subspaces is that error vector e, this is this is nothing but e --
29:13
this is this guy, coming in down perpendicular to the plane.
29:21
What subspace is e in? From this equation. Well the equation is saying a transpose e is zero.
29:34
So I'm learning here that e is in the null space
29:39
of a transpose.
29:44
Right? That's my equation. And now I just want to see hey of course that that was right.
29:51
Because things that are in the null space of a transpose,
29:57
what do we know about the null space of a transpose?
30:03
So that last lecture gave us the sort of the geometry of these subspaces.
30:09
And the orthogonality of them. And do you remember what it was? What on the right side of our big figure
30:16
we always have the null space of a transpose and the column space of a, and they're orthogonal.
30:27
So e in the null space of a transpose is saying e is perpendicular to the column space of a.
30:38
Yes.
30:44
I just feel OK, the damn thing came out right. The equation for the equation that I struggled to find for e
30:58
really said what I wanted, that the error
31:03
e is perpendicular to the column space of a, just right. And from our four fundamental subspaces
31:10
we knew that that is the same as that. To say e is in the null space of a transpose says
31:17
e's perpendicular to the column space. OK. So we've got this equation. Now let's just solve it.
31:23
All right. Let me just rewrite it as a transpose a x hat equals a transpose b.
31:34
That's our equation. That gives us x.
31:42
And -- allow me to keep remembering the one-dimensional
31:48
case. The one-dimensional case, this was little a.
31:54
So this was just a number, little a transpose, a transpose a was just a vector row times a column, a number.
32:02
And this was a number. And x was the ratio of those numbers. But now we've got matrices, this one is n by n.
32:12
a transpose a is an n by n matrix. OK. So can I move to the next board for the solution?
32:20
32:26
OK. This is the -- the key equation. Now I'm ready for the formulas that we have to remember.
32:35
What's x hat? What's the projection, what's the projection matrix,
32:41
those are my three questions. That we answered in the 1-D case and now we're ready for in the n-dimensional case.
32:49
So what is x hat? Well, what can I say but a transpose
32:55
a inverse, a transpose b.
33:01
That's the solution to -- to our equation.
33:07
OK. What's the projection? That's more interesting. What's the projection?
33:13
The projection is a x hat.
33:18
That's how x hat got into the picture in the first place. x hat was the was the combination of columns
33:28
in the I had to look for those numbers and now I found them. Was the combination of the columns of a
33:34
that gave me the projection. OK. So now I know what this guy is.
33:40
So it's just I multiply by a. a a transpose a inverse a transpose b.
33:50
33:56
That's looking a little messy but it's not bad.
34:03
That that combination is is our like magic combination. This is the thing which is which use which is like what's it
34:14
like, what was it in one dimension? What was that we had this we must
34:20
have had this thing way back at the beginning of the lecture. What did we -- oh that a was just a column so it was little
34:29
a, little a transpose over a transpose a, right,
34:36
that's what it was in 1-D. You see what's happened in more
34:46
dimensions, I -- I'm not allowed to to just divide because because I don't have a number, I have to put inverse,
34:52
because I have an n by n matrix. But same formula.
34:59
And now tell me what's the projection matrix? What matrix is multiplying b to give the projection?
35:08
Right there. Because there it --
35:15
I even already underlined it by accident. The projection matrix which I use capital P is this,
35:24
it's it's that thing, shall I write it again, a times a transpose a inverse times a transpose.
35:32
35:41
Now if you'll bear with me I'll think about what have I done
35:49
here. I've got this formula. Now the first thing that occurs to me is something bad.
36:00
Look why don't I just you know here's a product of two matrices and I want its inverse,
36:08
why don't I just use the formula I know for the inverse of a product and say OK,
36:14
that's a inverse times a transpose inverse, what
36:22
will happen if I do that? What will happen if I say hey this
36:29
is a inverse times a transpose inverse, then shall I do it?
36:36
It's going to go on videotape if I do it, and I don't --
36:41
all right, I'll put it there, but just like don't take the videotape quite so carefully.
36:48
OK. So if I put that thing it -- it would be a a inverse a transpose inverse a transpose and what's that?
36:59
That's the identity. But what's going on?
37:06
So why -- you see my question is somehow I did something wrong.
37:14
That that wasn't allowed. And and and why is that?
37:19
Because a is not a square matrix. a is not a square matrix.
37:25
It doesn't have an inverse. So I have to leave it that way.
37:31
This is not OK. If if a was a square invertible matrix, then then
37:36
I couldn't complain. Yeah I think -- let me think about that case.
37:44
But you but my main case, the whole reason I'm doing all this, is that a is this matrix that
37:51
has x too many rows, it's just got a couple of columns,
37:56
like a one and a two, but lots of rows. Not square.
38:02
And if it's not square, this a transpose a is square but I
38:07
can't pull it apart like this -- I'm not allowed to do this pull apart, except if a was square.
38:16
Now if a is square what's what's going on if a is a square matrix? a nice square inv- invertible matrix.
38:25
Think. What's up with that what's with that case. So this is that the formula ought to work then too.
38:34
If a is a nice square invertible matrix what's its column space, so it's a nice n by n invertible everything great matrix,
38:44
what's its column space, the whole of R^n.
38:50
So what's the projection matrix if I'm projecting onto the whole space?
38:56
It's the identity matrix right? If I'm projecting b onto the whole space,
39:04
not just onto a plane, but onto all of 3-D, then b is already in the column space,
39:11
the projection is the identity, and this is gives me the correct formula, P is I.
39:18
But if I'm projecting onto a subspace then I can't split those apart and I have to stay with that formula.
39:27
OK. And what can I say if -- so I remember this formula for 1-D
39:37
and that's what it looks like in n dimensions. And what are the properties that I expected for any projection
39:44
matrix? And I still expect for this one? That matrix should be symmetric and it is.
39:50
P transpose is P. Because if I transpose this, this guy's symmetric, and its inverse is symmetric,
39:59
and if I transpose this one when I transpose it will pop up there, become a, that a transpose will pop up
40:08
here, and I'm back to P again. And do we dare try the other property
40:14
which is P squared equal P?
40:24
It's got to be right. Because we know geometrically that the first projection pops
40:33
us onto the column space and the second one leaves us where we are. So I expect that if I multiply by let me do it --
40:43
if I multiply by another P, so there's another a, another a transpose a inverse a transpose, can you --
40:59
eight (a)-s in a row is quite obscene but -- do you see that it works?
41:05
So I'm squaring that so what do I do-- how do I
41:11
see that multiplication? Well, yeah, I just want to put parentheses in good places,
41:17
so I see what's happening, yeah, here's an a transpose a sitting together -- so when that a transpose a multiplies its
41:25
inverse, all that stuff goes, right. And leaves just the a transpose at the end,
41:32
which is just what we want. So P squared equals P. So sure enough those two
41:39
properties hold. OK. OK we really have got now all the formulas.
41:45
x hat, the projection P, and the projection matrix capital P. And now my job is to use them.
41:58
OK. So when would I have a bunch of equations,
42:05
too many equations and yet I want the best answer and the --
42:12
the most important example, the most common example is if I
42:19
have points so here's the -- here's the application.
42:25
v squared. Fitting by a line. OK.
42:42
So I'll start this application today and there's more in it than I can do in this same lecture.
42:50
So that'll give me a chance to recap the formulas and there they are, and recap the ideas.
42:59
So let me start the problem today. I'm given a bunch of data points.
43:10
And they lie close to a line but not on a line. Let me take that.
43:15
Say a t equal to one, two and three, I have one, and two and two again.
43:25
So my data points are this is the like the time direction
43:31
and this is like well let me call that b or y or something.
43:37
I'm given these three points and I want to fit them by a line.
43:43
By the best straight line. So the problem is fit the points one, one is the first point --
43:55
the second point is t equals two, b equal one,
44:02
and the third point is t equal three, b equal to two.
44:09
So those are my three points, t equal sorry,that's two.
44:14
Yeah, OK. So this is the point one, one. This is the point two, two, and that's the point three, two.
44:22
And of course there isn't a -- a line that goes through them. So I'm looking for the best line.
44:29
I'm looking for a line that probably goes somewhere, do you think it goes somewhere like that?
44:38
I didn't mean to make it go through that point, it won't. It'll kind of -- it'll go between so the error there and the error there
44:47
and the error there are as small as I can get them.
44:54
OK, what I'd like to do is find the matrix a.
45:00
Because once I've found the matrix a the formulas take over. So what I'm looking for this line, b is C+Dt.
45:11
So this is in the homework that I sent out for today.
45:16
Find the best line. So I'm looking for these numbers. C and D.
45:23
That tell me the line and I want them to be as close to going through those three points
45:30
as I can get. I can't get exactly so there are three equations to go through the three points.
45:37
It would it will go exactly through that point if let's see that first point has t equal to one,
45:45
so that would say C+D equaled 1. This is the one, one.
45:51
The second point t is two. So C+2D should come out to equal 2.
46:00
But I also want to get the third equation in and at that third equation t is three so C+3D equals only 2.
46:11
46:17
That's the key. Is to write down what equations we would like to solve
46:23
but can't. Reason we if we could solve them that would mean that we could put a line through all three points and of course
46:33
if these numbers one, two, two were different, we could do it.
46:39
But with those numbers, one, two, two, we can't. So what is our equation Ax equal Ax equal b that we can't solve?
46:49
I just want to say what's the matrix here, what's the unknown x, and what's the right-hand side.
46:56
So this is the matrix is one, one, one, one, two, three.
47:03
The unknown is C and D. And the right-hand side if one, two, two.
47:10
Right, I've just taken my equations
47:18
and I've said what is Ax and what is b.
47:28
Then there's no solution, this is the typical case where I have three equations -- two unknowns, no solution,
47:36
but I'm still looking for the best solution. And the best solution is taken is
47:45
is to solve not this equation Ax equal b which has which has no solution but the equation that
47:55
does have a solution, which was this one.
48:01
So that's the equation to solve. That's the central equation of the subject. I can't solve Ax=b but magically when I multiply both sides
48:12
by a transpose I get an equation that I can solve and its
48:22
solution gives me x, the best x, the best projection,
48:29
and I discover what's the matrix that's behind it.
48:36
OK. So next time I'll complete an example, numerical example.
48:44
today was all letters, numbers next time.
48:49
Thanks.
