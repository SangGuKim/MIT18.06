0:10
OK. This is linear algebra lecture eleven.
0:17
And at the end of lecture ten, I was talking about some vector
0:22
spaces, but they're -- the things in those vector spaces
0:29
were not what we usually call vectors. Nevertheless, you could add them and you
0:36
could multiply by numbers, so we can call them vectors. I think the example I was working
0:41
with they were matrices. So the -- so we had like a matrix space,
0:46
the space of all three by three matrices. And I'd like to just pick up on that, because --
0:55
we've been so specific about n dimensional space here,
1:00
and you really want to see that the same ideas work as long
1:05
as you can add and multiply by scalars. So these new, new vector spaces, the example I took
1:16
was the space M of all three by three matrices.
1:24
OK.
1:29
I can add them, I can multiply by scalars. I can multiply two of them together, but I don't do that.
1:36
That's not part of the vector space picture. The vector space part is just adding the matrices
1:43
and multiplying by numbers. And that's fine, we stay within this space of three
1:50
by three matrices. And I had some subspaces that were interesting,
1:56
like the symmetric, the subspace of symmetric matrices,
2:02
symmetric three by threes. Or the subspace of upper triangular three by threes.
2:13
Now I, I use the word subspace because it follows the rule.
2:21
If I add two symmetric matrices, I'm still symmetric. If I multiply two symmetric matrices,
2:27
is the product automatically symmetric? No. But I'm not multiplying matrices.
2:34
I'm just adding. So I'm fine. This is a subspace. Similarly, if I add two upper triangular matrices,
2:42
I'm still upper triangular. And, that's a subspace.
2:48
Now I just want to take these as example and ask, well, what's a basis for that subspace?
2:55
What's the dimension of that subspace? And what's bd- dimension of the whole space?
3:00
So, there's a natural basis for all three by three matrices,
3:07
and why don't we just write it down. So, so M, a basis for M.
3:21
Again, all three by threes.
3:27
OK. And then I'll just count how many members are in that basis
3:34
and I'll know the dimension. And OK, it's going to take me a little time.
3:40
In fact, what is the dimension? Any idea of what I'm coming up with next?
3:47
How many numbers does it take to specify that three by three matrix?
3:53
Nine. Nine is the, is the dimension I'm going to find.
3:59
And the most obvious basis would be the matrix that's
4:04
that matrix and then this matrix with a one there
4:12
and that's two of them, shall I put in the third one,
4:21
and then onwards, and the last one maybe
4:27
would end with the one. OK.
4:34
That's like the standard basis. In fact, our space is practically the same
4:40
as nine dimensional space. It's just the nine numbers are written in a square
4:48
instead of in a column. But somehow it's different and, and ought to be thought
4:54
of as -- natural for itself.
5:01
Because now what about the symmetric three by threes? So that's a subspace.
5:09
Just let's just think, what's the dimension of that subspace and what's a basis for that subspace.
5:16
OK. And I guess this question occurs to me. If I look at this subspace of symmetric three
5:24
by threes, well, how many of these original basis
5:32
members belong to the subspace? I think only three of them do.
5:38
This one is symmetric. This last one is symmetric.
5:43
And the one in the middle with a, with a one in that position -- in the two two position, would be symmetric.
5:52
But so I've got three of these original nine are symmetric, but, so this is an example where --
6:03
but that's, that's not all, right? What's the dimension? Let's put the dimensions down. Dimension of the, of M, was nine.
6:13
What's the dimension of -- shall we call this S -- is what?
6:19
What's the dimension of this? I'm sort of taking simple examples where we can, we can,
6:25
spot the answer to these questions. So how many -- if I have a symmetric --
6:32
think of all symmetric matrices as a subspace, how many parameters do I choose in three by three symmetric
6:40
matrices? Six, right. If I choose the diagonal that's three,
6:49
and the three entries above the diagonal, then I know what the three entries below.
6:55
So the dimension is six. I guess what's the dimension of this here?
7:00
Let's call this space U for upper triangular. So what's the dimension of that space of all upper triangular
7:09
three by threes? Again six. Again six.
7:14
And, but we haven't got a -- we haven't seen -- well, actually,
7:24
maybe we have got a basis here for, the upper triangulars.
7:29
I guess six of these guys, one, two, three, four,
7:35
and a, and a couple more, would be upper triangular. So there's a accidental case where the big basis contains
7:44
in it a basis for the subspace. But with the symmetric guy, it didn't have.
7:50
The symmetric guy the, basis -- so you see -- a basis is the basis for the big space,
7:56
we generally need to think it all over again to get a basis for the subspace.
8:03
And then how do I get other subspaces? Well, we spoke before about, the subspace the symmetric matrices
8:15
and the upper triangular. This is symmetric and upper triangular.
8:24
8:30
What's the, what's the dimension of that space?
8:36
OK. Well, what's in that space? So what's -- if a matrix is symmetric and also upper
8:42
triangular, that makes it diagonal. So this is the same as the diagonal matrices,
8:51
diagonal three by threes. And the dimension of this, of S intersect U, right --
9:03
you're OK with that symbol? That's, that's the vectors that are in both S and U,
9:10
and that's D. So S intersect U is the diagonals.
9:15
And the dimension of the diagonal matrices is three.
9:21
And we've got a basis, no problem. OK, as I write that, I think, OK, what about putting --
9:33
so this is like, this intersection -- is taking all the vectors that are
9:40
in both, that are symmetric and also upper triangular. Now we looked at the union.
9:50
Suppose I take the matrices that are symmetric or upper triangular.
9:59
What -- why was that no good? So why is it no -- why I not interested in the union,
10:08
putting together those two subspaces? So this, these are matrices that are in S or in U, or possibly
10:18
both, so they, the diagonals included. But what's bad about this? It's not a subspace.
10:27
It's like having, taking, you know, a couple of lines in the plane and stopping there.
10:34
A line -- this is -- so there's a three dimensional subspace
10:40
of a nine dimensional space, there's -- ooh, sorry, six. There's a six dimensional subspace
10:46
of a nine dimensional space. There's another one. But they, they're headed in different directions,
10:52
so we, we can't just put them together. We have to fill in. So that's what we do.
10:58
To get this bigger space that I'll write with a plus sign, this is combinations of things in S and things in U.
11:09
OK. So that's the final space I'm going to introduce.
11:15
I have a couple of subspaces. I can take their intersection. And now I'm interested in not their union but their sum.
11:24
So this would be the, this is the intersection, and this will be their sum.
11:31
So what do I need for a subspace here?
11:38
I take anything in S plus anything in U.
11:43
I don't just take things that are in S and pop in also, separately, things that are in U.
11:48
This is the sum of any element of S,
11:56
that is, any symmetric matrix, plus any
12:02
in U, any element of U.
12:08
OK. Now as long as we've got an example here, tell me what we get.
12:15
If I take every symmetric matrix, take all symmetric matrices, and add them
12:20
to all upper triangular matrices, then I've got a whole lot of matrices and it is a subspace.
12:27
And what's -- it's a vector space, and what vector space would I then have?
12:34
Any idea what, what matrices can I get out of a symmetric plus an upper triangular?
12:42
I can get anything. I get all matrices. I get all three by threes.
12:50
It's worth thinking about that. It's just like stretch your mind a little, just a little,
12:58
to, to think of these subspaces and what their intersection is
13:05
and what their sum is. And now can I give you a little -- oh, well, let's figure out the dimension.
13:10
So what's the dimension of S plus U?
13:17
In this example is nine, because we got all three by threes.
13:25
So the original spaces had, the original symmetric space had
13:31
dimension six and the original upper triangular space had dimension six.
13:38
And actually I'm seeing here a nice formula.
13:48
That the dimension of S plus the dimension of U --
13:54
if I have two subspaces, the dimension of one plus the dimension of the other -- equals the dimension
14:03
of their intersection plus the dimension of their sum. Six plus six is three plus nine.
14:12
That's kind of satisfying, that these natural operations --
14:20
and we've -- this is it, actually, this is the set of natural things to do with,
14:27
with subspaces. That, the dimensions come out in a good way.
14:36
OK. Maybe I'll take just one more example of a vector space
14:43
that doesn't have vectors in it. It's come from differential equations.
14:51
So this is a one more new vector space
14:57
that we'll give just a few minutes to. Suppose I have a differential equation like d^2y/dx^2+ y=0.
15:06
OK.
15:12
I look at the solutions to that equation. So what are the solutions to that equation?
15:21
y=cos(x) is a solution.
15:28
y=sin(x) is a solution. y equals -- well, e to the (ix) is a solution, if you want,
15:37
if you allow me to put that in. But why should I put that in? It's already there.
15:45
You see, I'm really looking at a null space here. I'm looking at the null space of a differential equation.
15:52
That's the solution space. And describe the solution space, all solutions
16:01
to this differential equation. So the equation is y''+y=0.
16:07
Cosine's, cosine's a solution, sine is a solution. Now tell me all the solutions.
16:14
They're -- so I don't need e^(ix). Forget that.
16:21
What are all the complete solutions?
16:30
Is what? A combination of these. The complete solution is y equals
16:38
some multiple of the cosine plus some multiple of the sine.
16:48
That's a vector space. That's a vector space. What's the dimension of that space?
16:54
What's a basis for that space? OK, let me ask you a basis first.
17:00
If I take the set of solutions to that second order differential equation --
17:06
there it is, those are the solutions. What's a basis for that space?
17:12
Now remember, what's the, what question I asking? Because if you know the question I'm asking,
17:18
you'll see the answer. A basis means all the guys in the space
17:25
are combinations of these basis vectors. Well, this is a basis.
17:31
sin x, cos x there is a basis.
17:38
Those two -- they're like the special solutions, right?
17:44
We had special solutions to Ax=b. Now we've got special solutions to differential equations.
17:53
Sorry, we had special solutions to Ax=0, I misspoke.
17:59
The special solutions were for the null space just as here we're talking about the null space. Do you see that here is a -- those two --
18:07
and what's the dimension of the solution space?
18:13
How many vectors in this basis?
18:23
Two, the sine and cosine. Are those the only basis for this space?
18:30
By no means. e^(ix) and e^(-ix) would be another basis.
18:37
Lots of bases. But do you see that really what a course in differential --
18:43
in linear differential equations is about is finding a basis
18:50
for the solution space. The dimension of the solution space will always be --
18:56
will be two, because we have a second order equation. So that's, like there's 18.03 in --
19:04
five minutes of 18.06 is enough to, to take care of 18.03.
19:10
So there's a -- that's one more example. OK. And of course the point of the example
19:16
is these things don't look like vectors.
19:24
They look like functions. But we can call them vectors, because we can add them
19:31
and we can multiply by constants, so we can take linear combinations. That's all we have to be allowed to do.
19:39
So that's really why this idea of linear algebra and basis and dimension and so on plays a wider role than --
19:51
our constant discussions of m by n matrices.
19:56
OK. That's what I wanted to say about that topic. Now of course the key, number associated with matrices,
20:09
to go back to that number, is the rank. And the rank, what do we know about the rank?
20:17
Well, we know it's not bigger than m
20:23
and it's not bigger than n. So but I'd like to have a little discussion on the rank.
20:29
Maybe I'll put that here. So I'm picking up this topic of rank one matrices.
20:38
And the reason I'm interested in rank one matrices
20:46
is that they ought to be simple. If the rank is only one, the matrix can't get away from
20:55
us. So for example, let me take -- let me create a rank one matrix.
21:00
OK. Suppose it's three -- suppose it's two by three.
21:07
And let me give you the first row.
21:16
What can the second row be? Tell me a possible second row here, for, for this matrix
21:24
to have rank one. A possible second row is?
21:30
Two eight ten. The second row is a multiple of the first row.
21:41
It's not independent. So tell me a basis for the -- oh yeah, sorry to keep bringing up these same questions.
21:50
After the quiz I'll stop, but for now, tell me a basis for the row space.
21:57
A basis for the row space of that matrix is the first row,
22:03
right? The first row, one four five. A basis for the column space of this matrix is?
22:11
What's the dimension of the column space? The dimension of the column space is also one,
22:19
right? Because it's also the rank. The dimension -- you remember the dimension of the column
22:24
space equals the rank equals the dimension of the column space
22:33
of the transpose, which is the row space of A.
22:38
OK, and in this case it's one, r is one.
22:44
And sure enough, all the columns are -- all the other columns are multiples of that column.
22:51
Now there's -- there ought to be a nice way to see that,
22:57
and here it is. I can write that matrix as its pivot column, one two,
23:06
times its -- times one four five.
23:11
A column times a row, one column times one row
23:18
gives me a matrix, right? If I multiply a column by a row, that,
23:25
g- that's a two by one matrix times a one by three matrix,
23:30
and the result of the multiplication is two by three. And it comes out right.
23:36
So what I want to -- my point is the rank one matrices that
23:45
every rank one matrix has the form some column times some
23:52
row. So U is a column vector, V is a column vector --
23:59
but I make it into a row by putting in V transpose. So that's the -- complete picture of rank one matrices.
24:12
We'll be interested in rank one matrices. Later we'll find, oh, their determinant, that'll be easy,
24:19
their eigenvalues, that'll be interesting. Rank one matrices are like the building blocks
24:26
for all matrices. And actually maybe you can guess.
24:37
If I took any matrix, a five by seventeen matrix of rank four,
24:47
then it seems pretty likely -- and it's true, that I could break that five by seventeen matrix down
24:56
as a combination of rank one matrices. And probably how many of those would I need?
25:03
If I have a five by seventeen matrix of rank four, I'll need four of them, right.
25:11
Four rank one matrices. So the rank one matrices are the, are the building blocks.
25:17
And out -- I can produce every, I can produce every five by --
25:23
every rank four matrix out of four rank one matrices.
25:29
That brings me to a question, of course. OK. Would the rank four matrices form a subspace?
25:36
Let me take all five by seventeen matrices and think
25:43
about rank four -- the subset of rank four matrices.
25:48
Let me -- I'll write this down.
25:53
You seem I'm reviewing for the quiz, because I'm asking the kind of questions that are short enough
26:00
but -- that bring out do you know what these words mean. So I take --
26:06
my matrix space M now is all five by seventeen matrices.
26:13
And now the question I ask is the subset of, of rank four
26:27
matrices, is that a subspace?
26:34
If I add a matrix of -- so if I multiply a matrix of rank four by --
26:39
of rank four or less, let's say, because I have to let the zero matrix in if it's going to be a subspace.
26:49
But, but that doesn't just because the zero matrix got in there doesn't mean I have a subspace.
26:56
So if I -- so the, the question really comes down to -- if I add two rank four matrices, is the sum rank four?
27:05
What do you think?
27:12
If -- no, not usually. Not usually. If I add two rank four matrices, the sum is probably --
27:20
what could I say about the sum? Well, actually, well, the rank could be five.
27:27
It's a general fact, actually, that the rank of A plus B
27:35
can't be more than rank of A plus the rank of B.
27:40
So this would say if I added two of those, the rank couldn't be larger than eight, but I know actually the rank couldn't be as large as eight anyway.
27:48
What -- how big could the rank be, for, for the rank of a matrix in M? Could be as large as five, right, right.
27:57
So they're all sort of natural ideas. So it's rank four matrices or rank one matrices --
28:05
let me, let me change that to rank one. Let me take the subset of rank one matrices.
28:12
Is that a vector space? If I add a rank one matrix to a rank one matrix?
28:19
No. It's most likely going to have rank two. So this is -- So I'll just make that point.
28:25
Not a subspace.
28:32
OK. OK. Those are topics that I wanted to, just
28:38
fill out the, the previous lectures. The I'll ask one more subspace question, a,
28:46
a more, a more, likely example. Suppose I'm in -- let me put, put this example on a new
28:53
board. Suppose I'm in R, in R^4.
28:58
29:03
So my typical vector in R^4 has four components, v1, v2, v3,
29:10
and v4. Suppose I take the subspace of vectors
29:21
whose components add to zero. So I let S be all v, all vectors v in four dimensional space
29:34
with v1+v2+v3+v4=0. So I just want to consider that bunch of vectors.
29:39
Is it a subspace, first of all? It is a subspace. It is a subspace.
29:57
What's -- how do we see that? It is a subspace.
30:04
I -- formally I should check. If I have one vector that with whose components add to zero
30:11
and I multiply that vector by six -- the components still add to zero, just six times as --
30:16
six times zero. If I have a couple of v and a w and I add them,
30:22
the, the components still add to zero. OK, it's a subspace. What's the dimension of that space
30:29
and what's a basis for that space? So you see how I can just describe a space and we --
30:37
we can ask for the dimension -- ask for the basis first and the dimension.
30:42
Of course, the dimension's the one that's easy to tell me in a single word.
30:48
What's the dimension of our subspace S here?
30:55
And a basis tell me -- some vectors in it.
31:01
Well, I'm going to make ask you again to guess the dimension.
31:07
Again I think I heard it. The dimension is three. Three.
31:12
Now how does this connect to our Ax=0?
31:18
Is this the null space of something? Is that the null space of a matrix?
31:24
And then we can look at the matrix and, and we know everything about those subspaces.
31:30
This is the null space of what matrix?
31:39
31:47
What's the matrix where the null space is then Ab=0.
31:53
So I want this equation to be Ab=0.
31:59
b is now the vector. And what's the matrix that, that we're seeing there?
32:07
It's the matrix of four ones.
32:14
Do you see that that's -- that if I look at Ab=0 for this
32:20
matrix A, I multiply by b and I get this requirement,
32:27
that the components add to zero. So I'm really when I speak about S --
32:33
I'm speaking about the null space of that matrix. OK. Let's just say we've got a matrix now,
32:41
we want its null space. Well, we -- tell me its rank first.
32:47
The rank of that matrix is one, thanks.
32:54
So r is one. What's the general formula for the dimension of the null space?
33:01
The dimension of the null space of a matrix is --
33:07
in general, an m by n matrix of rank r? How many independent guys in the null space?
33:16
n-r, right?
33:22
n-r. In this case, n is four, four columns.
33:31
The rank is one, so the null space is three dimensions. So of course y- you could see it in this case,
33:39
but you can also see it here in our systematic way of dealing with the four fundamental subspaces
33:49
of a matrix. So what actually what, what are all four subspaces
33:55
then? The row space is clear. The row space is in R^4.
34:01
Yeah, can we take the four fundamental subspaces of this matrix?
34:06
Let's just kill this example. The row space is one dimensional.
34:15
It's all multiples of that, of that row. The null space is three dimensional.
34:22
Oh, you better give me a basis for the null space. So what's a basis for the null space?
34:28
The special solutions. To find the special solutions, I look for the free variables.
34:34
The free variables here are -- there's the pivot. The free variables are two, three, and four.
34:44
So the basis, basis for S, for S will be --
34:52
I'm expecting three vectors, three special solutions.
35:01
I give the value one to that free variable, and what's the pivot variable if the --
35:12
this is going to be a vector in S? Minus one. Now they're always added to -- the entries add to zero.
35:20
The second special solution has a one in the second free variable, and again a minus one
35:26
makes it right. The third one has a one in the third free variable, and again a minus one makes it right.
35:34
That's my answer. That's the answer I would be looking for. The -- a basis for this subspace S,
35:43
you would just list three vectors, and those would be the natural three to list.
35:48
Not the only possible three, but those are the special three.
35:55
OK, tell me about the column space, What's the column space of this matrix A?
36:02
So the column space is a subspace of R^1,
36:13
because m is only one. The columns only have one component. So the column space of S, the column space of A is somewhere
36:23
in the space R^1, because we only have -- these columns are short.
36:30
And what is the column space actually?
36:36
I just, it's just talking with these words is what I'm doing.
36:42
The column space for that matrix is R^1.
36:48
The column space for that matrix is all multiples of that column.
36:55
And all multiples give you all of R^1.
37:00
And what's the, the remaining fourth space,
37:07
the null space of A transpose is what?
37:12
So we transpose A.
37:21
We look for combinations of the columns now that give zero for A transpose.
37:30
And there aren't any. The only thing, the only combination of these rows
37:36
to give the zero row is the zero combination. OK.
37:42
So let's just check dimensions. The null space has dimension three.
37:51
The row space has dimension one. Three plus one is four.
37:57
The column space has dimension one, and what's the dimension of this, like,
38:02
smallest possible space? What's the dimension of the zero space?
38:08
It's a subspace. Zero.
38:14
What else could it be? I mean, let's -- we have to take a reasonable answer -- and the only reasonable answer is zero.
38:20
So one plus zero gives -- this was n, the number of columns,
38:25
and this is m, the number of rows. And let's just, let me just say again
38:32
then the, the, the subspace that has only that one point, that point is zero dimensional, of course.
38:42
And the basis is empty, because if the dimension is zero, there shouldn't be anybody in the basis.
38:49
So the basis of that smallest subspace is the empty set.
38:56
And the number of members in the empty set is zero, so that's the dimension.
39:01
OK. Good. Now I have just five minutes to tell you about --
39:10
well, actually, about some, some, some, this is now,
39:16
this last topic of small world graphs, and leads into,
39:21
a lecture about graphs and linear algebra.
39:27
But let me tell you -- in these last minutes the graph that I interested in.
39:32
It's the graph where -- so what is a graph?
39:40
Better tell you that first. OK. What's a graph?
39:47
OK. This isn't calculus. We're not, I'm not thinking of, like, some sine curve.
39:54
The word graph is used in a completely different way. It's a set of, a bunch of nodes and edges,
40:07
edges connecting the nodes. So I have nodes like five nodes and edges --
40:17
I'll put in some edges, I could put, include them all. There's -- well, let me put in a couple more.
40:23
There's a graph with five nodes and one two three four
40:31
five six edges. And some five by six matrix is going to tell us
40:38
everything about that graph. Let me leave that matrix to next time
40:43
and tell you about the question I'm interested in. Suppose, suppose the graph isn't just,
40:52
just doesn't have just five nodes, but suppose every, suppose every person in this room is a node.
40:59
And suppose there's an edge between two nodes
41:07
if those two people are friends. So have I described a graph?
41:14
It's a pretty big graph, hundred, hundred nodes. And I don't know how many edges are in there.
41:21
There's an edge if you're friends.
41:27
So that's the graph for this class. A, a similar graph you could take for the whole country,
41:35
so two hundred and sixty million nodes. And edges between friends.
41:43
And the question for that graph is how many steps does it take
41:50
to get from anybody to anybody?
41:56
What two people are furthest apart in this friendship graph,
42:01
say for the US? By furthest apart, I mean the distance from --
42:08
well, I'll tell you my distance to Clinton. It's two.
42:14
I happened to go to college with somebody who knows Clinton. I don't know him.
42:19
So my distance to Clinton is not one, because I don't, happily
42:24
or not, don't know him. But I know somebody who does. He's a Senator and so I presume he knows him.
42:32
OK. I don't know what your -- well, what's your distance to Clinton?
42:39
Well, not more than three, right. Actually, true. You know me.
42:44
I take credit for reducing your Clinton distance to three --
42:50
what's your distance to Monica. Not, anybody below -- below four is in trouble here.
43:04
Or maybe three, but, right. So -- and what's Hillary's distance to Monica?
43:14
I don't think we'd better put that on tape here. That's one or two, I guess.
43:22
Is that right? I don't -- well, we won't, think more about that.
43:28
So actually, the, the real question is what are large distances?
43:38
How, how far apart could people be separated? And roughly this number six degrees of separation
43:46
has kind of appeared as the movie title, as the book title, and it's with this meaning.
43:52
That roughly speaking -- six might be a fairly --
43:59
not too many people. If you sit next to somebody on an airplane,
44:04
you get talking to them. You begin to discuss mutual friends to sort of find out,
44:12
OK, what connections do you have, and very often you'll find you're
44:17
connected in, like, two or three or four steps. And you remark, it's a small world,
44:23
and that's how this expression small world came up. But six, I don't know if you could find -- if it took six,
44:31
I don't know if you would successfully discover those six in a, in an airplane conversation.
44:36
But here's the math question, and I'll leave it for next, for lecture twelve,
44:42
and do a lot of linear algebra in lecture twelve. But the interesting point is that with a few shortcuts,
44:54
the distances come down dramatically. That, I mean, all your distances to Clinton immediately drop
45:03
to three by taking linear algebra. That's, like, an extra bonus for taking linear algebra.
45:11
And to understand mathematically what it is about these graphs
45:17
-- or like the graphs of the World Wide Web. There's a fantastic graph.
45:23
So many people would like to understand and model the web. What the -- where the edges are links and the nodes are, sites,
45:34
websites. I'll leave you with that graph, and I'll see you --
45:39
have a good weekend, and see you on Monday.
