SARAH HANSEN: Well, you have a lot of followers of your 18.06
0:11
videos.
0:11
GILBERT STRANG: That's wonderful.
0:13
SARAH HANSEN: And I'll read this quote to you.
0:16
"A commenter even noted that this is not lecture,
0:19
this is art."
0:20
GILBERT STRANG: Gosh.
0:21
OK.
0:22
Well, if you're going to ask what's my system, I have none.
0:27
0:30
I guess-- well, first I like students.
0:32
And I want to help.
0:34
And maybe the key point is to think with them.
0:42
Not to just say, OK, here it is, listen, listen up.
0:48
I think through the question all over again as they do.
0:55
And you have to give time.
0:56
You can't zip through a proof.
1:01
Because this class has to be sort of thinking with you.
1:05
And that's-- yeah, that's my thought.
1:11
I don't know if I achieve it, but I think it's the goal.
1:15
SARAH HANSEN: One of our users on OCW
1:19
noted that during lectures you sometimes ask
1:23
rhetorical questions, or maybe feign confusion as a way--
1:28
GILBERT STRANG: Feign confusion?
1:30
I'm confused.
1:31
SARAH HANSEN: Are you?
1:31
OK.
1:31
GILBERT STRANG: Well, no.
1:32
Well, no, it's probably true.
1:36
That's maybe part of not rushing through it.
1:41
But getting-- so I'll pause at the critical point, maybe.
1:49
You have to give time to see, OK, what's the next step?
1:57
You know, mathematics is beautifully ordered,
2:01
and sensible, and logical.
2:03
And linear algebra is not too difficult.
2:06
But still, you can't rush.
2:09
You have to sort of see the idea a few times.
2:14
First maybe on the board as symbols.
2:18
But not everybody picks up on symbols.
2:21
Then you say, what does it mean?
2:23
And then finally you say, why is it true?
2:26
But you don't say, "Why is it true?
2:28
Give the proof," the very first step.
2:31
You want to make people think, yeah, it is true.
2:34
2:37
SARAH HANSEN: Others have noted that you do this thing where
2:42
you display your own thinking kind of on the spot
2:45
as you work through problems.
2:47
GILBERT STRANG: Yeah.
2:48
SARAH HANSEN: Is there ever a risk in that for you?
2:50
GILBERT STRANG: Oh, yes.
2:52
And it happens, that I lose the thread
2:56
or I come up to a dead end where I don't know
3:00
what I'm supposed to do next.
3:01
But generally, especially in 18.06, The basic linear algebra
3:09
course that many people have watched,
3:14
there I kind of get it OK.
3:16
Yeah, I've taught it enough times
3:19
to have a good chance of getting it right.
3:23
SARAH HANSEN: Is this a strategy that you developed over time?
3:26
You know, lots of people are nervous to do that,
3:29
to make themselves vulnerable in front of a large lecture
3:32
class like that.
3:33
But you're working problems in real time
3:36
and demonstrating what happens when you hit a dead end.
3:38
GILBERT STRANG: Well, that's OK, because students
3:40
are going to hit dead ends, so it seems to me it's OK for me
3:44
to get stuck, too.
3:46
And then if they see, oh, OK, maybe this
3:50
is the way to get out of that corner.
3:53
Yeah.
3:55
So essentially I think the thing is I like students.
4:00
I like math.
4:01
And putting them together is just the best job in the world.
4:07
SARAH HANSEN: Let's talk about humor for a second.
4:09
GILBERT STRANG: OK.
4:10
SARAH HANSEN: You have been known
4:11
to say things like, keep things in their Gauss-given order.
4:15
GILBERT STRANG: I see.
4:16
SARAH HANSEN: And other really funny things that people
4:18
just love.
4:19
So what's the role of humor in your teaching?
4:23
GILBERT STRANG: Well, maybe it's--
4:24
which is what I'm saying here, maybe the key point
4:29
is to make it human.
4:31
You know, you're a person, like the student is a person.
4:36
The book isn't quite a person, but it was written by a person.
4:39
And to see that it's just like a natural thing to do.
4:47
Yeah.
4:47
Yeah.
4:48
Yeah.
4:49
SARAH HANSEN: So one of our users
4:50
was thinking about how you teach complex material, how
4:54
you convey it in ways that are comfortable for students.
4:58
And the user was wondering, how do
5:00
you know when to go into detail and when not to?
5:05
GILBERT STRANG: I suppose I try to think it through once again.
5:11
And then you sort of automatically
5:13
see the word-- you recognize what words you need to use,
5:18
and what the steps are.
5:21
Yeah.
5:23
If you're not thinking it yourself,
5:25
then you're probably going too fast
5:27
and not connecting with the thinking of the class.
5:35
SARAH HANSEN: And how do you connect
5:36
with the thinking of the class when it's such a large lecture
5:40
hall?
5:40
And everyone's at a different point in their understanding.
5:43
GILBERT STRANG: That's probably true.
5:43
And of course, you don't know what everybody
5:45
is thinking in that class.
5:47
But overall, if you get--
5:54
if you stay sort of conscious of the class, conscious of where
6:00
they are, that's, I think, the thing for any speaker,
6:06
is to be conscious of the audience
6:09
and not just a A-B inverse.
6:12
6:14
SARAH HANSEN: What else would you
6:15
like to add about teaching 18.06 linear algebra?
6:20
GILBERT STRANG: Well, with 18.06 of course, I'm just--
6:23
so, recently, Open CourseWare, which I think
6:26
was just such a great idea.
6:28
Great idea for MIT.
6:30
Great idea for faculty.
6:33
So they did a count of the number of viewers in 18.06,
6:39
and it was 10 million.
6:41
Which was like, woo.
6:43
I never expected.
6:44
But I do get nice, really nice messages
6:49
from all over the world.
6:52
And I reply to them far as I can.
6:55
6:58
Sometimes they'll ask what's a good way to learn math?
7:03
I don't know if I have an answer to that.
7:05
But anyway, I try to be encouraging.
7:08
So yeah.
7:13
It's been wonderful.
7:14
Just having the video lectures available
7:23
allows everybody to be in the class.
7:26
Yeah.
7:27
So, thank you all for joining the class.
7:32
Thank you.
