0:00
Are we ready? Okay, ready for me to start.
0:11
Ready for the taping to start in a minute.
0:23
He's going to raise his hand and signal when I'm on.
0:38
Just a minute, though, let them settle.0 Okay, guys.
0:50
Okay, give me the signal, then, when you want me to
1:02
start. Okay, this is linear algebra, lecture four. And, the first thing I have to do
1:11
is something that was on the list for last time, but here it is now. What's the inverse of a product?
1:19
If I multiply two matrices together and I know their inverses, how do I
1:25
get the inverse of A times B? So I know what inverses mean for a single matrix A
1:34
and for a matrix B. What matrix do I multiply by to get the identity if I have A B?
1:44
Okay, that'll be simple but so basic. Then I'm going to use that to --
1:52
I will have a product of matrices and the product that we'll meet will be these elimination matrices
1:59
and the net result of today's lectures is the big formula for elimination,
2:07
so the net result of today's lecture is this great way to look at Gaussian elimination.
2:18
We know that we get from A to U by elimination. We know the steps -- but now we get the right way to look
2:26
at it, A equals L U. So that's the high point for today.
2:32
Okay. Can I take the easy part, the first step first?
2:37
So, suppose A is invertible -- and of course it's going to be
2:42
a big question, when is the matrix invertible? But let's say A is invertible and B is invertible,
2:51
then what matrix gives me the inverse of A B? So that's the direct question.
2:58
What's the inverse of A B? Do I multiply those separate inverses?
3:03
Yes. I multiply the two matrices A inverse and B inverse,
3:08
but what order do I multiply? In reverse order. And you see why.
3:14
So the right thing to put here is B inverse A inverse.
3:20
That's the inverse I'm after. We can just check that A B times that matrix gives the identity.
3:30
Okay. So why -- once again, it's this fact that I can move
3:35
parentheses around. I can just erase them all and do the multiplications any way
3:42
I want to. So what's the right multiplication to do first? B times B inverse.
3:48
This product here I is the identity. Then A times the identity is the identity
3:55
and then finally A times A inverse gives the identity.
4:01
So forgive the dumb example in the book.
4:06
Why do you, do the inverse things in reverse order?
4:12
It's just like -- you take off your shoes, you take off your socks, then the good way to invert that
4:19
process is socks back on first, then shoes.
4:26
Sorry, okay. I'm sorry that's on the tape.
4:31
And, of course, on the other side we should really just check -- on the other side I have B inverse,
4:37
A inverse. That does multiply A B, and this time it's
4:43
these guys that give the identity, squeeze down, they give the identity, we're in shape.
4:48
Okay. So there's the inverse. Good. While we're at it, let me do a transpose,
4:56
because the next lecture has got a lot to -- involves transposes. So how do I -- if I transpose a matrix,
5:05
I'm talking about square, invertible matrices right now. If I transpose one, what's its inverse?
5:14
Well, the nice formula is -- let's see. Let me start from A, A inverse equal the identity.
5:23
So -- give me a first row. And let me transpose both sides.
5:30
That will bring a transpose into the picture. So if I transpose the identity matrix, what do I have?
5:39
The identity, right? If I exchange rows and columns, the identity
5:44
is a symmetric matrix. It doesn't know the difference. If I transpose these guys, that product, then again
5:54
it turns out that I have to reverse the order.
6:00
I can transpose them separately, but when I multiply, those transposes come in the opposite order.
6:07
So it's A inverse transpose times A transpose
6:12
giving the identity. So that's -- this equation is -- just comes directly from that
6:17
one. But this equation tells me what I wanted to know, namely what is the inverse of this guy A transpose?
6:26
What's the inverse of that -- if I transpose a matrix, what'ss the inverse of the result?
6:34
And this equation tells me that here it is. This is the inverse of A transpose.
6:45
Inverse of A transpose. Of A transpose.
6:52
So I'll put a big circle around that,
7:00
because that's the answer, that's the best answer we could hope for.
7:07
That if you want to know the inverse of A transpose
7:13
and you know the inverse of A, then you just transpose that. So in a -- to put it another way,
7:20
transposing and inversing you can do in either order for a single matrix.
7:26
Okay. So these are like basic facts that we can now use,
7:31
all right -- so now I put it to use. I put it to use by thinking -- we're really completing,
7:40
the subject of elimination. Actually, -- the thing about elimination is it's the right
7:52
way to understand what the matrix has got. This A equal L U is the most basic factorization
7:59
of a matrix.
8:04
I always worry that you will think
8:09
this course is all elimination.
8:15
It's just row operations. And please don't.
8:21
We'll be beyond that, but it's the right algebra to do first.
8:32
Okay. So, now I'm coming near the end of it, but I want to get it in a decent form.
8:40
So my decent form is matrix form. I have a matrix A, let's suppose it's a good matrix,
8:48
I can do elimination, no row exchanges -- So no row exchanges for now.
8:54
Pivots all fine, nothing zero in the pivot position.
8:59
I get to the very end, which is U. So I get from A to U.
9:06
And I want to know what's the connection? STUDENT: Zero one zero? How is A related to U?
9:13
And this is going to tell me that there's a matrix L that connects them.
9:19
Okay. Can I do it for a two by two first? Okay. Two by two, elimination.
9:25
Okay, so I'll do it under here. Okay. So let my matrix A be --
9:34
We'll keep it simple, say two and an eight, so we know that the first pivot is a two,
9:41
and the multiplier's going to be a four and then let me put a one here and what number
9:47
do I not want to put there? Four. I don't want a four there, because in that case,
9:54
the second pivot would not -- we wouldn't have a second pivot. The matrix would be singular, general screw-up.
10:02
Okay. So let me put some other number here like seven. Okay.
10:08
Okay. Now I want to operate on that with my elementary matrix.
10:15
So what's the elementary matrix? Strictly speaking, it's E21, because it's
10:20
the guy that's going to produce a zero in that position.
10:26
And it's going to produce U in one shot,
10:31
because it's just a two by two matrix. So two one and I'm going to take four of those away from those,
10:40
produce that zero and leave a three there. And that's U. And what's the matrix that did it?
10:46
Quick review, then. What's the elimination elementary matrix E21 --
10:52
it's one zero, thanks. And -- negative four one, right.
10:58
Good. Okay. So that -- you see the difference between this
11:03
and what I'm shooting for. I'm shooting for A on one side and the other matrices
11:10
on the other side of the equation. Okay. So I can do that right away.
11:17
Now here's going to be my A equals L U. And you won't have any trouble telling me what --
11:24
so A is still two one eight seven.
11:30
L is what you're going to tell me and U is still two one zero three.
11:36
Okay. So what's L in this case?
11:42
Well, first -- so how is L related to this E guy? It's the inverse, because I want to multiply through
11:52
by the inverse of this, which will put the identity here, and the inverse will show up there and I'll call it L.
12:00
So what is the inverse of this? Remember those elimination matrices are easy to invert.
12:09
The inverse matrix for this one is 1 0 4 1, it's actually flip
12:21
STRANG: Zero one zero. sign. Okay. Do you want -- if we did the numbers right, we must --
12:29
this should be correct. Okay. And of course it is. That says the first row's right, four times the first row
12:37
plus the second row is eight seven. Good. That's simple, two by two. Okay.
12:43
But it already shows the form that we're headed for.
12:49
It shows -- so what's the L stand for? Why the letter L?
12:54
If U stood for upper triangular, then of course L stands for lower triangular.
13:01
And actually, it has ones on the diagonal, where this thing has the pivots on the diagonal.
13:07
Oh, sometimes we may want to separate out the pivots,
13:16
so can I just mention that sometimes we could also write this as --
13:22
we could have this one zero four one -- I'll just show you how I would divide out this matrix
13:28
of pivots -- two three. There's a diagonal matrix.
13:34
And I just -- whatever is left is here. Now what's left?
13:41
If I divide this first row by two to pull out the two, then I have a one and a one half.
13:49
And if I divide the second row by three to pull out the three, then I have a one. Where shall we put them?4 So if this is L U,
13:58
this is maybe called L D or pivot U. And now it's a little more balanced,
14:06
because we have ones on the diagonal here and here.
14:11
And the diagonal matrix in the middle. So both of those...
14:19
Matlab would produce either one. I'll basically stay with L U.
14:26
Okay. Now I have to think about bigger than two by two.
14:32
But right now, this was just like easy exercise. And, to tell the truth, this one was a minus sign
14:41
and this one was a plus sign. I mean, that's the only difference.
14:47
But, with three by three, there's
14:52
a more significant difference. Let me show you how that works.
14:58
Let me move up to a three by three, let's say some matrix A, okay?
15:06
Let's imagine it's three by three.
15:12
I won't write numbers down for now. So what's the first elimination step
15:17
that I do, the first matrix I multiply it by, what letter will I use for
15:23
that? It'll be E two one, because it's -- the first step will be to get a zero in that two one position.
15:30
right? Okay, now a second row -- say zero zero one and the third guy And then the next step will be to get a zero in the three one
15:39
position. And the final step will be to get a zero in the three two
15:45
That's what elimination is, and it produced U. position.
15:51
And again, no row exchanges.
15:59
I'm taking the nice case, now, the typical case, too -- when I don't have to do any row exchange,
16:05
all I do is these elimination steps. Okay. Now, suppose I want that stuff over on the right-hand side,
16:14
as I really do. That's, like, my point here. I can multiply these together to get a matrix E,
16:21
but I want it over on the right. I want its inverse over there. So what's the right expression now?
16:31
If I write A and U, what goes there?
16:39
So I've got the inverse of this, I've got three matrices in Okay. a row now.
16:44
And it's their inverses that are going to show up, because each one is easy to invert.
16:50
Question is, what about the whole bunch? How easy is it to invert the whole bunch?
16:57
So, that's what we know how to do. We know how to invert, we should take the separate inverses,
17:04
but they go in the opposite order. So what goes here? E three two inverse, right, because I'll
17:11
multiply from the left by E three two inverse, then I'll pop it up next to U.
17:19
And then will come E three one inverse. And then this'll be the only guy left
17:27
standing and that's gone when Ido an E two one inverse. So there is L.
17:35
That's L U. L is product of inverses.
17:43
Now you still can ask why is this guy preferring inverses?
17:50
And let me explain why. Let me explain why is this product nicer than this one?
17:58
This product turns out to be better than this one.
18:03
Let me take a typical case here. Let me take a typical case.
18:09
So let me -- I have to do three by three for you to see the improvement.
18:15
Two by two, it was just one E, no problem. But let me go up to this case.
18:22
Suppose my matrices E21 -- suppose E21 has a minus two in there.
18:34
Suppose that -- and now suppose -- oh, I'll even suppose E31 is the identity. I'm going to make the point with just a couple of these. Okay. Now this guy will have -- do something --
18:51
now let's suppose minus five one. Okay. There's typical.
18:56
That's a typical case in which we didn't need an E31.
19:03
Maybe we already had a zero in that three one position. Okay.
19:10
Let me see -- is that going to be enough to, show my point?
19:17
Let me do that multiplication. So if I do that multiplication it's like good practice to
19:25
Okay. multiply these matrices. Tell me what's above the diagonal when I do this multiplication?
19:32
All zeroes. When I do this multiplication, I'm going to get ones on the diagonal and zeroes above.
19:39
Because -- what does that say? That says that I'm subtracting rows from lower rows.
19:47
So nothing is moving upwards as it did last time in Gauss-Jordan.
19:52
Okay. Now -- so really, what I have to do is check this minus two one
19:59
zero, now this is -- what's that number? This is the number that I'm really have in mind.
20:08
That number is ten. And this one is --
20:16
what goes here? Row three against column two, it looks like the minus five.
20:21
It's that ten.
20:28
How did that ten get in there? I don't like that ten. I mean -- of course, I don't want to erase it,
20:34
because it's right. But I don't want it there. It's because -- the ten got in there because I subtracted two
20:43
of row one from row two, and then I subtracted five of that
20:49
new row two from row three. So doing it in that order, how did row one effect row three?
20:58
Well, it did, because two of it got removed from row two and then five of those got removed from row three.
21:04
So altogether ten of row one got thrown into row three.
21:10
Now my point is in the reverse direction -- so now I can do it -- below it I'll do the inverses.
21:20
Okay. And, of course, opposite order. Reverse order. Reverse order.
21:29
Okay. So now this is going to -- this is the E that goes on the left
21:36
side. Left of A. Now I'm going to do the inverses in the opposite order,
21:44
so what's the -- So the opposite order means I put this inverse first.
21:50
And what is its inverse? What's the inverse of E21? Same thing with a plus sign, right?
21:57
For the individual matrices, instead of taking away two I add back two of row one to row two, so no problem.
22:06
And now, in reverse order, I want to invert that.
22:15
Just right? I'm doing just this, this. So now the inverse is again the same thing,
22:23
but add in the five.
22:29
And now I'll do that multiplication and I'll get a happy result.
22:38
I hope. Did I do it right so far? Yes, okay.
22:44
Let me do the multiplication. I believe this comes out. So row one of the answer is one zero zero.
22:50
Oh, I know that all this is going to be left, right? Then I have two one zero.
22:57
So I get two one zero there, right? And what's the third row?
23:05
What's the third row in this product?
23:14
Just read it out to me, the third row?
23:23
And this is my matrix L. And it's the one that goes on the left of U.
23:32
It goes into -- what do I mean here?
23:38
Maybe rather than saying left of A, left of U, let me right down again what I mean.
23:45
E A is U, whereas A is L U.
23:54
Okay. Let me make the point now in words.
23:59
The order that the matrices come for L is the right order. The two and the five don't sort of
24:08
interfere to produce this ten one zero zero.
24:14
in the right order, the multipliers just sit in the matrix L.
24:20
That's the point -- that if I want to know L,
24:28
I have no work to do. I just keep a record of what those multipliers were,
24:39
and that gives me L. So I'll draw the -- let me say it.
24:46
So this is the A=L U. So if no row exchanges, the multipliers that those numbers
25:04
that we multiplied rows by and subtracted, when we did an elimination step --
25:10
the multipliers go directly into L.
25:21
Okay. So L is -- this is the way, to look at elimination.
25:36
You go through the elimination steps, and actually if you do it right, you
25:43
can throw away A as you create L U.
25:50
If you think about it, those steps of elimination, as when you've finished with row two of A,
26:02
you've created a new row two of U, which you have to save,
26:07
and you've created the multipliers that you used -- So that is like a cycle. which you have to save,
26:13
and then you can forget A. So because it's all there in L and U.
26:22
So that's -- this moment is maybe the new insight
26:30
in elimination that comes from matrix --
26:35
doing it in matrix form. So it was -- the product of Es is --
26:43
we can't see what that product of Es is. The matrix E is not a particularly attractive one.
26:50
What's great is when we put them on the other side -- their inverses in the opposite order,
26:55
there the L comes out just right. Now -- oh gosh, so today's a sort of,
27:03
Okay. like, practical day. Can we think together how expensive is elimination?
27:14
How many operations do we do? So this is now a kind of new topic which I didn't list as --
27:23
on the program, but here it came.
27:29
How many operations on an n by n matrix A.
27:44
I mean, it's a very practical question.
27:52
Can we solve systems of order a thousand, in a second
27:58
or a minute or a week? Can we solve systems of order a million in a second or an hour
28:09
or a week? I mean, what's the -- if it's n by n, we often want to take n bigger.
28:19
I mean, we've put in more information. We make the whole thing is more accurate for the bigger matrix.
28:27
But it's more expensive, too, and the question is how much more expensive? If I have matrices of order a hundred.
28:36
Let's say a hundred by a hundred. Let me take n to be a hundred.
28:41
Say n equal a hundred. How many steps are we doing?
28:49
How many operations are we actually doing that we --
28:54
And let's suppose there aren't any zeroes, because of course if a matrix has got a lot of zeroes in good places,
29:00
we don't have to do those operations, and, it'll be much faster. It's going to move -- it's going to change all rows, But -- so just think for a moment about the first step.
29:10
So here's our matrix A, hundred by a hundred.
29:17
And the first step will be --
29:24
that column, is got zeroes down here. So it's down to 99 by 99, right?
29:35
That's really like the first stage of elimination, That puts row two moves up to row one,
29:41
row three moves up to to get from this hundred by hundred non-zero matrix to this stage
29:46
where the first pivot is sitting up here and the first row's okay the first column is okay.
29:54
So, eventually -- how many steps did that take? You see, I'm trying to get an idea.
30:01
Is the answer proportional to n? Is the total number of steps in elimination, the total number,
30:10
is it proportional to n -- in which case if I double n from a hundred to two hundred -- does it take me twice as long?
30:18
Does it square, so it would take me four times as long? Does it cube so it would take me eight times as long?
30:25
Or is it n factorial, so it would take me a hundred times as long?
30:31
I think, you know, from a practical point of view, we have to have some idea of the cost, here.
30:38
So these are the questions that I'm -- let me ask those questions again. Is it proportional -- does it go like N, like N squared,
30:47
like N cubed -- or some higher power of N? Like N factorial where every step up multiplies by a hundred
30:57
and then by a hundred and one and then by a hundred and two -- which is it?
31:02
Okay, so that's the only way I know to answer that is to think through what we actually
31:08
had to do. Okay. So what was the cost here?
31:17
Well, let's see. What do I mean by an operation? I guess I mean, well an addition or --
31:27
yeah. No big deal. I guess I mean an addition or a subtraction or a multiplication or a division.
31:33
Okay. And actually, what operation I doing all the time?
31:42
When I multiply row one by multiplier L and I
31:48
subtract from row six. What's happening there individually?
31:56
What's going on? If I multiply -- I do a multiplication by L and then a subtraction.
32:03
So I guess operation -- Can I count that for the moment as, like, one operation?
32:10
Or you may want to count them separately. The typical operation is multiply plus a subtract.
32:19
So if I count those together, my answer's going to come out
32:26
What's that? half as many as if -- I mean, if I count them separately, I'd have a certain number of multiplies,
32:32
certain number of subtracts. That's really want to do. How many have I got here? Okay. So, I think -- let's see.
32:37
32:44
It's about -- well, how many, roughly?
32:51
How many operations to get from here to here? Well, maybe one way to look at it
32:57
is all these numbers had to get changed. The first row didn't get changed,
33:03
but all the other rows got changed at this step. So this step -- well, I guess maybe --
33:10
shall I say it cost about a hundred squared.
33:17
I mean, if I had changed the first row,
33:23
then it would have been exactly hundred squared, because -- because that's how many numbers are here.
33:30
A hundred squared numbers is the total count of the entry, and all but this insignificant first row got changed.
33:39
So I would say about a hundred squared. Okay. Now, what about the next step?
33:45
So now the first row is fine.
33:51
The second row is fine. And I'm changing these zeroes are all fine,
33:58
so what's up with the second step? And then you're with me. Roughly, what's the cost?
34:05
If this first step cost a hundred squared, about, operations then this one, which
34:12
is really working on this guy to produce this, costs about what?
34:18
How many operations to fix?
34:26
About ninety-nine squared, or ninety-nine times ninety-eight. But less, right?
34:31
Less, because our problem's getting smaller. About ninety-nine squared.
34:37
And then I go down and down and the next one will be ninety-eight squared, the next ninety-seven squared and finally I'm down around one squared or --
34:44
where it's just like the little numbers. The big numbers are here.
34:51
So the number of operations is about n squared plus that
34:58
was n, right? n was a hundred? n squared for the first step, then n minus one squared,
35:06
then n minus two squared, finally down to three squared and two squared and even one squared.
35:13
35:18
No way I should have written that -- squeezed that in. Let me try it so the count is N squared plus N minus one
35:31
squared plus -- all the way down to one squared.
35:36
That's a pretty decent count. Admittedly, we didn't catch every single tiny operation,
35:45
but we got the right leading term here.
35:52
And what do those add up to? Okay, so now we're coming to the punch of this,
36:02
question, this operation count. So the operations on the left side, on the matrix A
36:09
to finally get to U.
36:15
And anybody -- so which of these quantities is the right
36:20
ballpark for that count? If I add a hundred squared to ninety nine squared to ninety
36:27
eight squared -- ninety seven squared, all the way down to two squared then one squared,
36:34
what have I got, about? It's just one of these -- let's identify it first.
36:43
Is it N? Certainly not. Is it n factorial?
36:50
No. If it was n factorial, we would -- with determinants, it is n factorial.
36:57
I'll put in a bad mark against determinants, because that --
37:04
okay, so what is it? It's n -- well, this is the answer.
37:12
It's this order -- n cubed. It's like I have n terms, right?
37:21
I've got n terms in this sum. And the biggest one is N squared. So the worst it could be would be n cubed,
37:29
but it's not as bad as -- it's N cubed times --
37:35
it's about one third of n cubed.
37:40
That's the magic operation count.
37:49
Somehow that one third takes account of the fact that the numbers are getting smaller.
37:57
If they weren't getting smaller, we would have n terms times n squared, but it would be exactly n cubed.
38:03
But our numbers are getting smaller -- actually, row two and row one moves down to row three.
38:09
do you remember where does one third come in this -- I'll even allow a mention of calculus.
38:15
So calculus can be mentioned, integration can be mentioned now in the next minute and not again for weeks.
38:23
It's not that I don't like 18.01, but18.06 is better.
38:28
Okay. So, -- so what's -- what's the calculus formula that looks
38:38
like? It looks like -- if we were in calculus instead of summing stuff, we would integrate.
38:46
So I would integrate x squared and I would get one third x
38:52
cubed. So if that was like an integral from one to N,
39:00
of x squared b x, if the answer would be one third n cubed -- and it's correct for the sum also, because that's, like,
39:09
the whole point of calculus. The whole point of calculus is -- oh, I don't want to tell you the whole -- I mean, you know the whole point of calculus.
39:18
Calculus is like sums except it's continuous.
39:24
Okay. And algebra is discreet. Okay. So the answer is one third n cubed.
39:30
Now I'll just -- let me say one more thing about operations. What about the right-hand side?
39:37
This was what it cost on the left side. This is on A.
39:44
Because this is A that we're working with. But what's the cost on the extra column vector b
39:52
that we're hanging around here? So b costs a lot less, obviously,
40:00
because it's just one column. We carry it through elimination and then
40:07
actually we do back substitution. Let me just tell you the answer there. It's n squared.
40:14
So the cost for every right hand side is n squared. So let me --
40:19
I'll just fit that in here -- for the the cost of b turns out
40:30
to be n squared. So you see if we have, as we often
40:37
have, a a matrix A and several right-hand sides,
40:43
then we pay the price on A, the higher price on A to get it
40:50
split up into L and U to do elimination on A, but then we can process every right-hand side at low cost.
40:58
Okay. So the -- We really have discussed the most fundamental
41:05
algorithm for a system of equations.
41:12
Okay. So, I'm ready to allow row exchanges.
41:24
I'm ready to allow -- now what happens to this whole -- today's lecture if there are row exchanges?
41:30
When would there be row exchanges?
41:38
There are row -- we need to do row exchanges if a zero shows up in the pivot position. So moving then into the final section of this chapter,
41:48
which is about transposes -- well, we've already seen some transposes, and --
41:56
the title of this section is, So tell -- there is another one here.
42:04
"Transposes and Permutations." Okay.
42:11
So can I say, now, where does a permutation come in?
42:16
Let me talk a little about permutations. So that'll be up here, permutations.
42:27
So these are the matrices that I need to do row exchanges.
42:35
And I may have to do two row exchanges. Can you invent a matrix where I would
42:42
have to do two row exchanges and then would come out fine?
42:50
Yeah let's just, for the heck of it -- so I'll put it here.
42:57
Let me do three by threes. Actually, why don't I just plain list
43:03
all the three by three permutation matrices. There're a nice little group of them.
43:09
What are all the matrices that exchange no rows at all?
43:16
Well, I'll include the identity.
43:22
So that's a permutation matrix that doesn't do anything. Now what's the permutation matrix that exchanges --
43:30
what is P12? The permutation matrix that exchanges rows one and two
43:36
would be -- 0 1 0 --
43:42
1 0 0, right. I just exchanged those rows of the identity and I've got it.
43:49
Okay. Actually, I'll -- yes. Let me clutter this up. Okay.
43:55
Give me a complete list of all the row exchange matrices.
44:02
So what are they? They're all the ways I can take the identity matrix and rearrange its rows.
44:10
How many will there be? How many three by three permutation matrices?
44:18
Shall we keep going and get the answer? So tell me some more. What one are you going to do now?
44:28
I'm going to switch rows one and -- One and three, okay. One and three, leaving two alone. Now what else? Okay. Switch -- what would be the next easy one -- is switch two and three, good. So I'll leave one zero zero alone and I'll switch --
44:50
I'll move number three up and number two down.
44:56
Okay. Those are the ones that just exchange single -- a pair of rows.
45:02
This guy, this guy and this guy exchanges a pair of rows, but now there are more possibilities.
45:08
What's left? And there's one more, which is --
45:17
let's see. What's left? I'm lost.
45:23
STUDENT: Is it zero zero one?
45:28
STRANG: Okay. STUDENT: One zero zero. STRANG: One zero zero, okay.
45:37
Zero one zero. Okay. Great.
45:42
Six. Six of them. Six P. And they're sort of nice, because what
45:55
happens if I write, multiply two of them together?
46:04
If I multiply two of these matrices together,
46:12
what can you tell me about the answer?
46:20
It's on the list. If I do some row exchanges and then I
46:33
do some more row exchanges, then all together
46:41
I've done row exchanges. So if I multiply -- but, I don't know.
46:51
And if I invert, then I'm just doing row exchanges to get back again.
46:57
So the inverses are all there. It's a little family of matrices that --
47:03
they've got their own -- if I multiply,
47:08
I'm still inside this group. If I invert I'm inside this group -- actually, group is the right name for this subject.
47:15
It's a group of six matrices, and what about the inverses?
47:21
What's the inverse of this guy, for example? What's the inverse -- if I exchange rows one and two,
47:27
what's the inverse matrix? Just tell me fast.
47:33
The inverse of that matrix is -- if I exchange rows one and two, then
47:42
what I should do to get back to where I started is the same thing.
47:47
So this thing is its own inverse. That's probably its own inverse.
47:53
This is probably not -- actually, I think these are inverses of each other. Oh, yeah, actually --
48:00
the inverse is the transpose. There's a curious fact about permutations matrices,
48:08
that the inverses are the transposes. And final moment -- how many are there if I --
48:16
how many four by four permutations? So let me take four by four --
48:22
how many Ps? Well, okay.
48:29
Make a good guess. Twenty four, right. Twenty four Ps.
48:38
48:44
Okay.
48:51
So, we've got these permutation matrices,
49:29
and in the next lecture, we'll use them.
