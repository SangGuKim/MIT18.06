0:07
OK, this lecture is like the beginning of the second half of this is to prove.
0:13
this course because up to now we paid a lot of attention
0:18
to rectangular matrices. Now, concentrating on square matrices,
0:27
so we're at two big topics. The determinant of a square matrix,
0:32
so this is the first lecture in that new chapter on determinants, and the reason, the big reason
0:38
we need the determinants is for the Eigen values. So this is really determinants and Eigen values,
0:46
the next big, big chunk of 18.06. OK, so the determinant is a number associated
0:57
with every square matrix, so every square matrix has this number associated with called the, its determinant.
1:07
I'll often write it as D E T A or often also I'll write it as,
1:15
A with vertical bars, so that's going to mean the determinant of the matrix.
1:21
That's going to mean this one, like, magic number.
1:26
Well, one number can't tell you what the whole matrix was.
1:32
But this one number, just packs in as much information as possible into a single number,
1:39
and of course the one fact that you've seen before and we have to see it again is the matrix
1:48
is invertible when the determinant is not zero.
1:53
The matrix is singular when the determinant is zero. So the determinant will be a test for invertibility,
2:03
but the determinant's got a lot more to it than that, so let me start.
2:08
OK, now the question is how to start. Do I give you a big formula for the determinant,
2:14
all in one gulp? I don't think so! That big formula has got too much packed in it.
2:21
I would rather start with three properties of the determinant,
2:28
three properties that it has. And let me tell you property one.
2:33
The determinant of the identity is one.
2:39
OK. I... I wish the other two properties were as easy to tell you as that.
2:46
But actually the second property is pretty straightforward too, and then once we get the third we will actually
2:56
have the determinant. Those three properties define the determinant and we can --
3:02
then we can figure out, well, what is the determinant?
3:13
What's a formula for it? Now, the second property is what happens if you
3:22
exchange two rows of a matrix. What happens to the determinant?
3:27
So, property two is exchange rows, reverse the sign of the determinant.
3:46
3:51
A lot of plus and minus signs. I even wrote here, "plus and minus signs," because this is, like, that's what
3:57
you have to pay attention to in the formulas and properties of determinants.
4:03
So that -- you see what I mean by a property here?
4:08
I haven't yet told you what the determinant is, but whatever it is, if I exchange
4:13
two rows to get a different matrix that reverses the sign of the determinant.
4:20
And so now, actually, what matrices do we now know the determinant of?
4:28
From one and two, I now know the determinant. Well, I certainly know the determinant of the identity
4:34
matrix and now I know the determinant of every other matrix that comes from row exchanges
4:41
from the identities still. So what matrices have I gotten at this point?
4:48
The permutations, right. At this point I know every permutation matrix,
4:55
so now I'm saying the determinant of a permutation matrix is one or minus one.
5:03
One or minus one, depending whether the number of exchanges
5:09
was even or the number of exchanges was odd.
5:16
So this is the determinant of a permutation. Now, P is back to standing for permutation.
5:22
OK. if I could carry on this board, I could, like,
5:28
do the two-by-two's. So, property one tells me that this two-by-two matrix.
5:34
Oh, I better write absolute -- I mean, I'd better write vertical bars, not brackets,
5:41
for that determinant. Property one said, in the two-by-two case,
5:46
that this matrix has determinant one. Property two tells me that this matrix has determinant --
5:59
what? Negative one. This is, like, two-by-twos.
6:04
Now, I finally want to get -- well, ultimately I want to get to,
6:10
the formula that we all know. Let me put that way over here, that the determinant
6:16
of a general two-by-two is ad-bc.
6:23
OK. I'm going to leave that up, like, as the two by two case I'm down to the product of the diagonal and if I transpose, that we already know, so that every property, I can, like, check that it's correct for two-by-twos.
6:44
But the whole point of these properties is that they're going to give me a formula for n-by-n.
6:51
That's the whole point. They're going to give me this number that's
6:57
a test for invertibility and other great properties for any size matrix.
7:02
OK, now you see I'm like, slowing down because property
7:08
three is the key property. Property three is the key property and can I somehow
7:17
describe it -- maybe I'll separate it into 3A I said that if you do a row exchange, the determinant and 3B.
7:26
Property 3A says that if I multiply one of the rows, say the first row, by a number T --
7:40
I'm going to erase that. That's, like, what I'm headed for but I'm not there yet.
7:46
It's the one we know and you'll see that it's checked out by each property.
7:54
OK, so this is for any matrix.
8:00
For any matrix, if I multiply one row by T and leave the other row or other n-1 rows alone,
8:08
what happens to the determinant? The factor T comes out.
8:15
It's T times this determinant.
8:22
That's not hard. I shouldn't have made a big deal out of property 3A, and 3B is that, if is, is if I keep --
8:29
I'm always keeping this second row the same, or that last n-1 rows are all staying the same.
8:37
I'm just working -- I'm just looking inside the first row and if I have
8:43
an a+a' there and a b+b' there --
8:53
sorry, I didn't. Ahh. Why don't -- I'll use an eraser, do it right.
8:59
b+b' there. You see what I'm doing? This property and this property are about linear combinations,
9:06
of the first row only, leaving the other rows unchanged.
9:13
They'll copy along. Then, then I get the sum -- this breaks up into the sum of this
9:20
determinant and this one.
9:32
I'm putting up formulas. Maybe I can try to say it in words. The determinant is a linear function.
9:41
It behaves like a linear function of first row
9:48
if all the other rows stay the same. I not saying that --
9:54
let me emphasize. I not saying that the determinant of A plus B
10:00
is determinant of A plus determinant of B.
10:07
I not saying that. I'd better -- can I -- how do I get it onto tape that I'm not saying that?
10:15
You see, this would allow all the rows -- you know,
10:22
A to have a bunch of rows, B to have a bunch of rows. That's not the linearity I'm after.
10:29
I'm only after linearity in each row. Linear for each row.
10:38
Well, you may say I only talked about the first row,
10:44
but I claim it's also linear in the second row, if I had this -- but not, I can't, I can't have
10:53
a combination in both first and second. If I had a combination in the second row,
10:58
then I could use rule two to put it up in the first row,
11:04
use my property and then use rule two again to put it back,
11:09
so each row is OK, not only the first row, but each row separately.
11:17
OK, those are the three properties, and from those properties, so that's
11:23
properties one, two, three. From those, I want to get all --
11:31
I'm going to learn a lot more about the determinant. Let me take an example.
11:38
What would I like to learn? I would like to learn that -- so here's our property four.
11:43
Let me use the same numbering as here. Property four is if two rows are equal, the determinant is zero.
11:58
OK, so property four. Two equal rows lead to determinant equals zero.
12:13
Right. Now, of course I can -- in the two-by-two case I can check,
12:19
sure, the determinant of ab ab comes out zero. But I want to see why it's true for n-by-n.
12:28
Suppose row one equals row three for a seven-by-seven matrix.
12:36
So two rows are the same in a big matrix. And all I have to work with is these properties.
12:43
The exchange property, which flips the sign, and the linearity property which works in each row separately.
12:53
OK, can you see the reason? How do I get this one out of properties one, two, three?
13:02
Because -- that's all I have to work with. Everything has to come from properties one, two, three.
13:07
OK, so suppose I have a matrix, and two rows are even.
13:14
How do I see that its determinant has to be zero from these properties?
13:22
I do an exchange. Property two is just set up for this.
13:27
Use property two. Use exchange -- exchange rows.
13:33
Exchange those rows, and I get the same matrix.
13:40
Of course, because those rows were equal.
13:47
So the determinant didn't change. But on the other hand, property two says that the sign did change.
13:56
So the -- so I, I have a determinant whose sign doesn't change and does change, and the only possibility then
14:03
is that the determinant is zero. You see the reasoning there?
14:08
Straightforward. Property two just told us, hey, if we've got two equal rows we.
14:15
we've got a zero determinant. And of course in our minds, that matches the fact
14:22
that if I have two equal rows the matrix isn't invertible. If I have two equal rows, I know that the rank
14:29
is less changes sign. than n. OK, ready for property five.
14:34
Now, property five you'll recognize as P. It says that the elimination step that I'm always doing,
14:45
or U and U transposed, when they're triangular,4 subtract
14:51
a multiple, subtract some multiple l times row one from
15:00
another row, row k, let's say.
15:07
You remember why I did that. In elimination I'm always choosing this multiplier so as
15:14
to produce zero in that position. What I -- way, way back in property two,4
15:21
Or row I from row k, maybe I should just make very clear that there's nothing special about row one
15:28
here. OK, so that, you can see why I want that who cares?
15:34
one, because that will allow me to start with this full matrix whose determinant I don't know,
15:40
and I can do elimination and clean it out. I can get zeroes below the diagonal
15:47
by these elimination steps and the point is that the determinant, the determinant doesn't change.
15:58
16:10
So all those steps of elimination are OK not changing the determinant. In our language in the early chapter the determinant of A is
16:18
So if I do seven row exchanges, the determinant changes sign, going to be the same as the determinant of U,
16:23
the upper triangular one. It just has the pivots on the diagonal. That's why we'll want this property.
16:29
OK, do you see where that property's coming from?
16:34
Let me do the two-by-two case. Let me do the two-by-two case here.
16:39
So, I'll keep property five going along. So what I doing?
16:45
I'm going to keep -- I'm going to have ab cd, but I'm going
16:52
to subtract l times the first row from the second row. And that's the determinant and of
17:03
OK, that's not -- I didn't put in every comma and, course I can multiply that out and figure out, sure enough, ad-bc
17:10
is there and this minus ALB plus ALB cancels out,
17:17
but I just cheated, right? I've got to use the properties. So what property? Well, of course, this is a com --
17:24
I'm keeping the first row the same and the second row has a c and a d, and then there's
17:31
the determinant of the A and the B, and the minus LA, and the minus LB.
17:37
So what property was that?
17:44
3B. I kept one row the same and I had
17:49
a combination in the second, in the other row, and I just separated it out.
17:56
OK, so that's property 3. That's by number 3, 3B if you like.
18:03
OK, now use 3A. How do you use 3A, which says I can factor out an l,
18:10
I can factor out a minus l here. I can factor a minus l out from this row, no problem.
18:17
That was 3A. So now I've used property three and now I'm ready for the kill.
18:25
Property four says that this determinant is zero,
18:32
has two equal rows. You see how that would always work?
18:37
I subtract a multiple of one row from another one. It gives me a combination in row k of the old row and l times
18:46
this copy of the higher row, and then if -- since I have two equal rows, that's zero,
18:53
so the determinant after elimination is the same as before. Good.
18:59
OK. Now, let's see -- if I rescue my glasses, I can see what's property six.
19:07
Oh, six is easy, plenty of space. Row of zeroes leads to determinant of A equals zero.
19:22
A complete row of zeroes.
19:28
So I'm again, this is like, something I'll use in the singular case.
19:34
Actually, you can look ahead to why I need these properties. So I'm going to use property five, the elimination,
19:42
use this stuff to say that this determinant is the same as that determinant and I'll produce a zero there.
19:49
But what if I also produce a zero there? What if elimination gives a row of zeroes?
19:54
That, that used to be my test for, mmm, singular, not invertible, rank two -- rank less than N,
20:03
and now I'm seeing it's also gives determinant zero. How do I get that one from the previous properties?
20:12
'Cause I -- this is not a new law, this has got to come from the old ones. So what shall I do?
20:20
Yeah, use -- that's brilliant. If you use 3A with T equals zero.
20:26
Right. So I have this zero zero cd, and I'm
20:32
trying to show that that determinant is zero. triangular matrices, l and l transposed, OK, so the zero is the same is -- five,
20:41
can I take T equals five, just to, like, pin it down? I'll multiply this row by five.
20:48
Five, well then, five of this should -- if I, if there's a factor five in that, you see what --
21:01
so this is property 3A, with taking T as five. If I multiply a row by five, out comes a five.
21:08
So why I doing this?
21:14
Oh, because that's still zero zero, right? So that's this determinant equals
21:21
five times this determinant, and the determinant has to be zero.
21:28
I think I didn't do that the very best way.
21:34
You were, yeah, you had the idea better. Multiply, yeah, take T equals zero.
21:40
Was that your idea? Take T equals zero in rule 3B.
21:46
If T is zero in rule 3B, and I bring the camera back to rule
21:51
3B -- sorry. If T is zero, then I have a zero zero there
22:01
and the determinant is zero. OK, one way or another, a row of zeroes means zero determinant.
22:08
OK, now I have to get serious.
22:14
The next properties are the ones that we're building up to.
22:20
OK, so I can do elimination. I can reduce to a triangular matrix
22:26
and now what's the determinant of that triangular matrix? OK, so they had to wait until the last minute.
22:34
Suppose, suppose I -- all right, rule seven. So suppose my matrix is now triangular.
22:42
So it's got -- so I even give these the names of the pivots, d1, d2, to dn,
22:48
and stuff is up here, I don't know what that is,
22:54
but what I do know is this is all zeroes. That's all zeroes, and I would like to know the determinant,
23:04
because elimination will get me to this. So once I'm here, what's the determinant then?
23:11
Let me use an eraser to get those, get that vertical bar again, so that I'm taking the determinant of U so that, so,
23:22
what is the determinant of an upper triangular matrix?
23:28
Do you know the answer?
23:36
It's just the product of the d's. for it. The -- these things that I don't even put in letters
23:44
for, because they don't matter, the determinant is d1 times d2
23:53
times dn. If I have a triangular matrix, then the diagonal
24:02
is all I have to work with. And that's, that's telling us then. We now have the way that MATLAB, any reasonable software,
24:15
would compute a determinant. If I have a matrix of size a hundred,
24:20
the way I would actually compute its determinant would be elimination, make it triangular, multiply the pivots together,
24:27
but it -- would it be possible t- to produce the same matrix the product of the pivots,
24:33
the product of pivots. Now, there's always in determinants a plus or minus
24:39
and cross every T in that proof, but that's really
24:44
the sign to remember. Where -- where does that come into this rule?
24:51
Could it be, could the determinant be minus the product of the pivots?
24:58
The determinant is d1, d2, to dn. No doubt about that. But to get to this triangular form,
25:05
we may have had to do a row exchange, so, so this --
25:12
it's the product of the pivots if there were no row exchanges. If, if SLU code, the simple LU code,
25:19
the square LU went right through. If we had to do some row exchanges, then we've got to watch plus or minus.
25:26
OK, but though -- this law is simply that. OK, how do I prove that?
25:33
Let's see, let me suppose that d's are not zeroes.
25:42
The pivots are not zeroes. And tell me, how do I show that none of this upper stuff
25:50
makes any difference? How do I get zeroes there?
25:56
By elimination, right? I just multiply this row by the right number,
26:01
subtract from that row, kills that. I multiply this row by the right number, kills that,
26:09
by the right number, kills that. Now, you kill every one of these off-diagonal terms, no problem
26:15
and I'm just left with the diagonal. Well, strictly speaking, I still have
26:22
to figure out why is, for a diagonal matrix now, why is that the right determinant?
26:28
I mean, we sure hope it is, but why?
26:37
I have to go back to properties one, two, three. Why is -- now that the matrix is suddenly diagonal,
26:46
how do I know that the determinant is just a product of That's my proof, really, that once I've got those diagonal entries?
26:53
Well, what I going to use? I'm going to use property 3A, is that right? I'll factor this, I'll factor this,
27:01
I'll factor that d1 out and have one and have the first row will be that.
27:07
And then I'll factor out the d2, shall I shall I put the d2 here, and the second row
27:13
will look like that, and so on. So I've factored out all the d's and what I left with?
27:20
The identity. And what rule do I finally get to use? Rule one.
27:26
Finally, this is the point where rule one finally chips in and says that this determinant is one,
27:33
so it's the product of the d's. So this was rules five, to do elimination,
27:40
3A to factor out the D's, and, and our best friend, rule one.
27:48
And possibly rule two, the exchanges may have been needed also.
27:53
OK. Now I guess I have to consider also the case if some d is
28:01
zero, because I was assuming I could use the d's to clean out
28:06
and make a diagonal, but what if -- what if one of those diagonal entries is zero?
28:13
Well, then with elimination we know that we can get a row of zeroes, and for a row
28:21
of zeroes I'm using rule six, the determinant is zero, and that's right. So I can check the singular case.
28:28
In fact, I can now get to the key point that determinant of A
28:36
is zero, exactly when, exactly when A is singular.
28:44
And otherwise is not singular, so that the determinant
28:52
is a fair test for invertibility or non-invertibility.
28:58
So, I must be close to that because I can take any matrix and get there.
29:05
Do I -- did I have anything to say? The, the proofs, it starts by saying by elimination
29:12
go from A to U. Oh, yeah. Actually looks to me like I don't -- haven't said anything brand-new here, that, that really,
29:22
I've got this, because let's just remember the
29:28
By elimination, I can go from the original A to reason.
29:37
Well, OK, now suppose the matrix is U. singular.
29:43
If the matrix is singular, what happens? Then by elimination I get a row of zeroes
29:50
and therefore the determinant is zero. And if the matrix is not singular, I don't get zero,
29:59
so maybe -- do you want me to put this, like, in two parts? The determinant of A is not zero when A is invertible.
30:10
30:15
Because I've already -- in chapter two we figured out when is the matrix invertible.
30:23
It's invertible when elimination produces a full set of pivots and now, and we now, we know the determinant is the product
30:31
of those non-zero numbers. So those are the two cases. If it's singular, I go to a row of zeroes.
30:39
If it's invertible, I go to U and then to the diagonal D,
30:49
and then which -- and then to d1, d2, up to dn.
30:57
As the formula -- so we have a formula now.
31:02
We have a formula for the determinant and it's actually a very much more practical
31:08
formula than the but they didn't matter anyway. ad-bc formula. Is it correct, maybe you should just -- let's just check that.
31:18
Two-by-two. What are the pivots of a two-by-two matrix?
31:23
What does elimination do with a two-by-two matrix? It -- there's the first pivot, fine.
31:30
What's the second pivot? We subtract, so I'm putting it in this upper triangular form.
31:38
What do I -- my multiplier is c over a, right?
31:44
I multiply that row by c over a and I subtract to get that zero, and here I
31:50
have d minus c over a times b.
31:58
That's the elimination on a two-by-two. So I've finally discovered that the determinant of this matrix
32:07
-- I've got it from the properties, not by knowing the answer from last year, that the determinant of this two-by-two
32:18
is the product of A times that, and of course when I multiply A by that, the product of that and that
32:26
is ad minus, the a is canceled, bc.
32:34
So that's great, provided a isn't zero. because all math professors watching this will be waiting If a was zero, that step wasn't allowed, with seven row
32:42
exchanges and with ten row exchanges? zero wasn't a pivot. So that's what I -- I've covered all the bases.
32:48
I have to -- if a is zero, then I have to do the exchange, and if the exchange doesn't work, it's because a is proof.
32:56
singular. OK, those are --
33:03
those are the direct properties of the determinant. And now, finally, I've got two more, nine and ten.
33:11
And that's -- I think you can... Like, the ones we've got here are
33:25
totally connected with our elimination process and whether pivots are available and whether we
33:35
get a row of zeroes. I think all that you can swallow in one shot.
33:40
Let me tell you properties nine and ten.
33:46
They're quick to write down. They're very, very useful.
33:53
So I'll just write them down and use them. Property nine says that the determinant of a product --
34:01
if I That's the, like, concrete proof that, multiply two matrices.
34:07
So if I multiply two matrices, A and B, that the determinant of the product
34:14
is determinant of A times determinant of B, and for me
34:26
that one is like, that's a very valuable property,
34:31
and it's sort of like partly coming out of the blue, because we haven't been multiplying matrices
34:37
and here suddenly this determinant has this multiplying property.
34:44
Remember, it didn't have the linear property, it didn't have the adding property. The determinant of A plus B is not
34:52
the sum of the determinants, but the determinant of A times B is the product, is the product of the determinants.
35:01
OK, so for example, what's the determinant of A inverse?
35:06
35:12
Using that property nine.
35:19
Let me, let me put that under here because the camera is happier if it can focus on both at once.
35:27
So let me put it underneath. The determinant of A inverse, because property ten
35:34
will come in that space.
35:40
What does this tell me about A inverse, its determinant? OK, well, what do I know about A inverse?
35:47
I know that A inverse times A is odd.
35:54
So what I going to do? I'm going to take determinants of both sides.
36:02
The determinant of I is one, and what's the determinant of A inverse A?
36:10
That's a product of two matrices, A and B. So it's the product of the determinant,
36:15
so what I learning? I'm learning that the determinant of A inverse times the determinant of A
36:24
is the determinant of I, that's this one. Again, I happily use property one.
36:31
OK, so that tells me that the determinant of A inverse is one over.
36:37
Here's my -- here's my conclusion -- is one over the determinant of A.
36:53
I guess that that -- I, I always try to think, well, do we know some cases of that?
36:59
Of course, we know it's right already if A is diagonal. If A is a diagonal matrix, then its determinant
37:09
is just a product of those numbers. So if A is, for example, two-three,
37:14
then we know that A-inverse is one-half one-third,
37:20
and sure enough, that has determinant six,
37:26
and that has determinant one-sixth. And our rule checks.
37:32
So somehow this proof, this property has to --
37:39
somehow the proof of that property -- if we can boil it down to diagonal matrices then we can
37:45
read it off, whether it's A and A-inverse, or two different diagonal matrices A and B.
37:52
For diagonal -- so what I saying? I'm saying for a diagonal matrices, check.
37:59
But we'd have to do elimination steps, we'd have to patiently do the, the, argument
38:08
if we want to use these previous properties to get it for other matrices. And it also tells me -- what, just let's, see what else
38:18
it's telling me. What's the determinant of, of A-squared? If I take a matrix and square it?
38:26
Then the determinant just got squared. Right? The determinant of A-squared is the determinant
38:34
of A times the determinant of A. So if I square the matrix, I square the determinant. If I double the matrix, what do I do to the non-zeroes flipped
38:43
to the other side of the diagonal, determinant? Think about that one. If I double the matrix, what -- so the determinant of A,
38:52
since I'm writing down, like, facts that follow, the determinant of A-squared is the determinant of A,
39:02
all squared. The determinant of 2A is what?
39:09
That's A plus A.
39:16
But wait, er, I don't want the answer to determinant of A here.
39:22
That's wrong. It's not two determinant of A, What is it? OK, one more coming, which I I have to make,
39:28
what's the number that I have to multiply determinant of A by if I double the whole matrix, if I
39:34
double every entry in the matrix? What happens to the determinant? If that were possible, that would be a bad thing,
39:41
Supposed it's an n-by-n matrix. that gets -- get down to triangular Two to the n, right.
39:46
Two to the nth. Now, why is it two to the nth, and not just two?
39:54
So why is it two to the nth? Because I'm factoring out two from every row.
40:02
There's a factor -- this has a factor two in every row, so I can factor two out of the first row.
40:08
I factor a different two out of the second row, a different two out of the nth row, so I've got all those twos coming out.
40:15
So it's like volume, really, and that's one of the great applications of determinants.
40:23
If I -- if I have a box and I double all the sides,
40:30
I multiply the volume by two to the nth. If it's a box in three dimensions,
40:38
I multiply the volume by 8.
40:43
So this is rule 3A here. This is rule nine.
40:49
And notice the way this rule sort of checks out with
40:55
the singular/non-singular stuff, that if A is invertible,
41:02
what does that mean about its determinant? It's not zero, and therefore this makes sense.
41:08
The case when determinant of A is zero, that's the case where my formula doesn't work anymore.
41:19
If determinant of A is zero, this is ridiculous, and that's ridiculous.
41:25
A-inverse doesn't exist, and one over zero doesn't make sense.
41:31
So don't miss this property. It's sort of, like, amazing that it can...
41:38
And the tenth property is equally simple to state,
41:44
that the determinant of A transposed equals the determinant of A.
41:57
And of course, let's just check it on the ab cd guy.
42:03
We could check that sure enough, that's ab cd, it works.
42:09
It's ad - bc, it's ad - bc, sure enough. So that transposing did not change the determinant.
42:19
But what it does change is --
42:24
well, what it does is it lists, so all -- I've been working with rows.
42:31
If a row is all zeroes, the determinant is zero. But now, with rule ten, I know what to do
42:40
is a column is all zero. If a column is all zero, what's the determinant?
42:46
Zero, again. So, like all those properties about rows, exchanging two rows
42:53
reverses the sign. Now, exchanging two columns reverses the sign, because I can always, if I
43:00
want to see why, I can transpose, those columns become rows, I do the exchange, I transpose back.
43:08
And I've done a column operation. So, in, in conclusion, there was nothing special about row one,
43:17
'cause I could exchange rows, and now there's nothing special about rows that isn't equally true for columns
43:25
because this is the same. OK. And again, maybe I won't --
43:32
oh, let's see. Do we...? Maybe it's worth seeing a quick proof of this number ten,
43:37
quick, quick, er, proof of number ten.
43:44
Er, let me take the -- this is number ten. A transposed equals A.
43:51
Determinate of A transposed equals determinate of A.
43:56
That's what I should have said. OK. So, let's just, er.
44:07
A typical matrix A, if I use elimination, this factors into LU.
44:16
And the transpose is U transpose, l transpose.
44:21
Er... let me.
44:29
So this is proof, this is proof number ten, using --
44:36
well, I don't know which ones I'll use, so I'll put 'em all in, one to nine.
44:42
OK. I'm going to prove number ten by using one to nine. I won't cover every case, but I'll cover almost every
44:50
case. So in almost every case, A can factor into LU, and A transposed can factor into that.
44:57
Now, what do I do next? So I want to prove that these are the same.
45:03
I see a product here. So I use rule nine.
45:09
So, now what I want to prove is, so now I know that this is LU,
45:14
this is U transposed and l transposed. Now, just for a practice, what are all those determinants?
45:24
So this is, this is, this is prove this, prove this, prove this, and now I'm ready to do it.
45:32
What's the determinant of l? You remember what l is, it's this lower triangular matrix
45:40
with ones on the diagonals. So what is the determinant of that guy? I- It's one.
45:48
Any time I have this triangular matrix, I can get rid of all the non-zeroes,
46:00
down to the diagonal case.
46:07
The determinate of l is one. How about the determinant of l transposed?
46:21
That's triangular also, right? Still got those ones on the diagonal,
46:28
it's just the matrices and then get down to diagonal matrices.
46:59
right? If If I could -- why would it be bad?
47:09
My whole lecture would die, right? Because rule two said that if you do seven row exchanges,
47:37
then the sign of the determinant reverses.
47:47
But if you do ten row exchanges, the sign of the determinant
47:56
stays the same, because minus one ten times is plus one.
48:02
OK, so there's a hidden fact here, that every --
48:16
like, every permutation, the permutations are either odd or even.
48:23
I could get the permutation with seven row exchanges, then I could probably get it with twenty-one, or twenty-three, or a hundred and one,
48:31
if it's an odd one. Or an even number of permutations, so, but that's the key fact that just takes
48:39
another little algebraic trick to see, and that means that the determinant is well-defined
48:45
by properties one, two, three and it's got properties four to ten. OK, that's today and I'll try to get the homework for next Wednesday onto the web this afternoon. Thanks.
