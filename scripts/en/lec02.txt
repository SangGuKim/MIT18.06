0:00
2 times this equation, Okay.
0:12
This is it. The second lecture in linear algebra,
0:17
and I've put below my main topics for today.
0:25
I put right there a system of equations that's going to be our example to work with. But what are we going to do with it?
0:35
We're going to solve it. And the method of solution will not be determinants.
0:41
Determinants are something that will come later. The method we'll use is called elimination.
0:47
And it's the way every software package solves equations.
0:53
And elimination, well, if it succeeds, it gets the answer.
1:03
And normally it does succeed. If the matrix A that's coming into that system
1:09
is a good matrix, and I think this one is, then elimination will work. We'll get the answer in an efficient way.
1:18
But why don't we, as long as we're sort of seeing how elimination works -- it's always good to ask how could it
1:25
fail? So at the same time, we'll see how elimination decides whether the matrix is a good one
1:32
or has problems. Then to complete the answer, there's an obvious step of back substitution.
1:40
In fact, the idea of elimination is -- you would have thought of it, right?
1:47
I mean Gauss thought of it before we did, but only because he was born earlier.
1:54
It's a natural idea... and died earlier, too.
2:00
Okay, and you've seen the idea.
2:07
But now, the part that I want to show you is elimination expressed in matrix language, because the whole course --
2:16
all the key ideas get expressed as matrix operations, not as
2:21
words. And one of the operations, of course, that we'll meet
2:27
is how do we multiply matrices and why? Okay, so there's a system of equations.
2:34
Three equations and three unknowns. And there's the matrix, the three by three matrix --
2:42
so this is the system Ax = b.
2:47
This is our system to solve, Ax equal -- and the right-hand side is that vector 2, 12, 2.
2:55
Okay. Now, when I describe elimination --
3:00
it gets to be a pain to keep writing the equal signs and the pluses and so on.
3:06
It's that matrix that totally matters. Everything is in that matrix.
3:12
But behind it is those equations. So what does elimination do?
3:17
What's the first step of elimination?
3:22
We accept the first equation, it's okay. I'm going to multiply that equation by the right number,
3:29
the right multiplier and I'm going to subtract it from the second equation.
3:36
With what purpose? So that will decide what the multiplier should be.
3:41
Our purpose is to knock out the x part of equation two.
3:50
So our purpose is to eliminate x. So what do I multiply --
3:57
and again, I'll do it with this matrix, because I can do it short. What's the multiplier here?
4:03
What do I multiply -- equation one and subtract. Notice I'm saying that word subtract.
4:08
I'd like to stick to that convention. I'll do a subtraction.
4:13
First of all this is the key number that I'm starting with.
4:19
And that's called the pivot. I'll put a box around it and write its name down.
4:25
That's the first pivot. The first pivot.
4:30
Okay. So I'm going to use -- that's sort of like the key number in that equation.
4:35
And now what's the multiplier? So I'm going to -- my first row won't change, that's the pivot row.
4:45
But I'm going to use it -- and now, finally, let me ask you what the multiplier is.
4:51
Yes? 3 times that first equation will knock out that 3.
4:58
Okay. So what will it leave? So the multiplier is 3. 3 times that will make that 0.
5:05
That was our purpose. 3 2s away from the 8 will leave a 2 and three 1s away from 1
5:11
will leave a minus 2. And this guy didn't change.
5:17
Now the next step -- this is forward elimination and that Okay. step's completed.
5:23
Oh, well, you could say wait a minute, what about the right hand side? Shall I carry -- the right-hand side gets carried along.
5:32
Actually MatLab finishes up with the left side before -- and then just goes back to do the right side.
5:38
Maybe I'll be MatLab for a moment and do that. Okay.
5:44
I'm leaving a room for a column of b, the right-hand side. But I'll fill it in later.
5:51
Okay. Now the next step of elimination is what? Well, strictly speaking...
5:56
this position that I cleaned up was like the 2, 1 position,
6:05
row 2, column 1. So I got a 0 in the 2, 1 position.
6:10
I'll use 2,1 as the index of that step. The next step should be to finish the column
6:17
and get a 0 in that position. So the next step is really the 3,1 step, row three,
6:24
column one. But of course, I already have 0.
6:30
Okay. So the multiplier is 0. I take 0 of this equation away from this one and I'm all set.
6:39
So I won't repeat that, but there was a step there which, MatLab would have to look -- it would look at this number
6:48
and, do that step, unless you told it in advance that it was 0.
6:53
Okay. Now what? Now we can see the second pivot, which is what?
7:00
The second pivot -- see, we've eliminated -- x is now gone from this equation, right?
7:06
We're down to two equations in y and z.
7:12
And so now I just do it again. Like, everything's recursive at this -- this is like -- such a basic algorithm and you've seen it,
7:20
but carry me through one last step.
7:25
So this is still the first pivot. Now the second pivot is this guy, who has appeared there.
7:32
And what's the multiplier, the appropriate multiplier now? And what's my purpose?
7:38
Is it to wipe out the 3, 2 position, right?
7:44
This was the 2, 1 step. And now I'm going to take the 3, 2 step.
7:53
So this all stays the same, 1 2 1, 0 2 -1
8:00
and the pivots are there. Now I'm using this pivot, so what's the multiplier?
8:05
8:10
this row, gets subtracted from this row and makes that a 0. So it's 0, 0 and is it a 5?
8:20
Yeah, I guess it's a 5, is that right? Because I have a one there and I'm
8:26
subtracting twice of twice this, so I think it's a 5 there.
8:32
There's the third pivot. So let me put a box around all three pivots.
8:41
Is there a -- oh, did I just invent a negative one?
8:48
I'm sorry that the tape can't, correct that as easily as I can.
8:55
Okay. Thank you very much.
9:00
You get an A in the course now. Is that correct?
9:07
Is it correct now? Okay. So the three pivots are there --
9:15
I know right away a lot about this matrix. This elimination step from A -- this matrix I'm going to call
9:24
U. U for upper triangular. So the whole purpose of elimination
9:29
was to get from A to U. And, literally, that's the most common calculation
9:35
in scientific computing. And people think of how could I do that faster? Because it's a major, major thing.
9:44
But we're doing it the straightforward way. We found three pivots, and by the way, I didn't say this,
9:52
pivots can't be 0. I don't accept 0 as a pivot.
9:57
And I didn't get 0. So this matrix is great. It gave me three pivots, I didn't
10:03
have to do anything special, I just followed the rules and, and the pivots are 1, 2 and 5.
10:11
By the way, just because I always anticipate stuff from a later day, if I wanted to know the determinant of this matrix
10:20
-- which I never do want to know, but I would just multiply the pivots. The determinant is 10.
10:25
So even things like the determinant are here.
10:32
Okay. Now -- oh, let me talk about failure for a moment,
10:38
and then -- and then come back to success.
10:44
How could this have failed? How could -- by fail, I mean to come up with three pivots.
10:54
I mean, there are a couple of points.
11:00
I would have already been in trouble if this very first number here was 0.
11:06
If it was a 0 there -- suppose that had been a 0, there were no Xs in that equation -- first equation.
11:14
Does that mean I can't solve the problem? Does that mean I quit? No.
11:21
What do I do? I switch rows. I exchange rows. So in case of a 0, I will not say 0 pivot.
11:30
I will never be heard to utter those words, 0 pivot. But if there's a 0 in the pivot position,
11:37
maybe I can say that, I would try to exchange for a lower equation and get a proper pivot up
11:45
there. Okay. Now, for example, this second pivot came out two.
11:51
Could it have come out 0? What -- actually, if I change that 8 a little bit,
11:56
I would have got a little trouble.
12:01
What should I change that 8 to so that I run into trouble?
12:08
A 6. If that had been a 6, then this would have been 0
12:14
and I couldn't have used that as the pivot. But I could have exchanged again.
12:20
In this case. In this case, because when can I get out of trouble?
12:26
I can get out of trouble if there's a non-0 below this troublesome 0.
12:32
And there is here. So I would be okay in this case. If this was a 6, I would survive by a row
12:40
exchange. Now -- of course, it might have happened that I couldn't do
12:46
the row, that -- that there was 0s below it, but here there wasn't. Now, I could also have got in trouble if this number 1 was
12:55
a little different. See, that 1 became a 5, I guess, by the end.
13:02
So can you see what number there would
13:08
have got me trouble that I really couldn't get out of?
13:14
Trouble that I couldn't get out of would mean if 0 is in the pivot position
13:22
and I've got no place to exchange. So there must be some number which if I had had here
13:31
it would have meant failure. Negative 4, good. If it was a negative 4 here -- if it happened to be a negative
13:39
4, I'll temporarily put it up here. If this had been a negative 4 z, then I
13:47
would have gone through the same steps. This would have been a minus 4, it still would have been a minus 4.
13:53
But at the last minute it would have become 0. And there wouldn't have been a third pivot.
14:02
The matrix would have not been invertible. Well, of course, the inverse of a matrix is coming next week,
14:08
but, you've heard these words before. So, that's how we identify failure.
14:16
There's temporary failure when we can do a row exchange -- and get out of it, or there's complete failure when we get
14:24
a 0 and -- and there's nothing below that we can use. Okay.
14:29
Let's stay with -- back to success now. In fact, I guess the next topic is back substitution.
14:39
So what's back substitution? Well, now I'd better bring the right-hand side in.
14:46
So what would MatLab do and what should we do?
14:52
Let me bring in the right-hand side as an extra column. So there comes B. So it's 2, 12, I would call this the augmented matrix.
15:05
"Augment" means you've tacked something on. I've tacked on this extra column.
15:11
Because, when I'm working with equations, I do the same thing to both sides.
15:17
So, at this step, I subtracted 2 of the first equation away from the second equation so that this augmented --
15:26
I even brought some colored chalk, but I don't know if it
15:31
shows up. So this is like the augmented -- no! Damn, circled the wrong thing.
15:39
Okay. Here is b. Okay, that's the extra column.
15:46
Okay. So what happened to that extra column, the right-hand side of the equations,
15:51
when I did the first step? So that was 3 of this away from this, so it took --
15:57
the 2 stayed the same, but three 2s got taken away from 12, leaving 6, and that 2 stayed the same.
16:04
So this is how it's looking halfway along. And let me just carry to the end.
16:11
The 2 and the 6 stay the same, but --
16:16
what do I have here? Oh, gosh.
16:23
Help me out, now. What -- so now I'm -- This is still like forward elimination.
16:29
I got to this point, which I think is right, and now what did I do at this step? I multiplied that pivot by 2 or that whole equation by 2
16:38
and subtracted from that, so I think I take two 6s, which is 12, away from the 2.
16:43
Do you think minus 10 is my final right-hand side --
16:49
the right-hand side that goes with U, and let me call that once and forever the vector c.
16:56
So c is what happens to b, and U is what happens to A.
17:04
Okay. There you've seen elimination clean. Okay.
17:11
Oh, what's back substitution? So what are my final equations, then?
17:16
Can I copy these equations? x+2y+z=2 is still there and 2y-2z=6 is there, and 5z=-10.
17:34
Okay. Those are the equations that these numbers
17:40
are telling me about. Those are the equations U x equals c.
17:46
Okay, how do I solve them? What one do I solve for first?
17:52
z. I see immediately that the correct value of z is negative
17:59
And what do I do next? I go back upwards. I now know z here.
18:07
So, if z is negative 2, that's 4 there, is that right?
18:12
And so 2 y plus a 4 is 6, maybe y is 1.
18:17
Going -- this is back substitution. We're doing it on the fly because it's so easy.
18:23
And then x is -- so x -- 2y is 2 minus 2, maybe x is 2?
18:31
18:38
So you see what back substitution is. It's the simple step solving the equations in reverse order
18:46
because the system is triangular. Okay. Good.
18:52
So that's elimination and back substitution, and I kept the right-hand side along.
18:57
Okay, now what do I -- that, like, is first piece of the
19:04
lecture. What's the second piece? Matrices are going to get in.
19:11
So I wrote stuff with x, y-s and z-s in there, then I really,
19:17
got the right shorthand, just writing the matrix entries,
19:24
and now I want to write the operations that I did in matrices, right?
19:32
I've carried the matrices along, but I haven't said the operation those elimination steps,
19:42
I now want to express as matrices. Okay. Here they come.
19:49
So now this is elimination matrices.
19:55
Okay. Let me take that first step, which took me from 1 2 1 3 8 1
20:02
0 4 1.
20:09
I want to operate on that -- I want to do elimination on that.
20:16
Okay. Okay, now I'm remembering a point I want to single out as especially important.
20:29
Let me move the board up for that.
20:36
Because when we do matrix operations, we've got to, like, be able to see the big picture.
20:41
Okay. Last time, I spoke about the big picture of -- when I multiply a matrix by a right-hand side.
20:50
If I have some matrix there and I multiply it by 3 4 5, let's say --
20:55
so here's a matrix -- what did I say -- well, I guess I only said it
21:02
on the videotape, but -- do you remember how I look at that matrix multiplication?
21:08
The result of multiplying a matrix by some vector is a combination of the columns of the matrix.
21:21
It's 3 times the first column. It's 3 times column one plus 4 times column two plus 5 times
21:33
column three.
21:39
Okay. I'm going to come back to that multiple times. What I wanted to do now was to emphasize the parallel thing
21:51
with rows. Why? Because all our operations here for this two weeks
21:59
of the course are row operations. So this isn't what I need for row operations.
22:10
Let me do a row operation. Suppose I have my matrix again and suppose I multiply
22:20
on the left by some -- let's say 1 2 7.
22:28
Again, I'm just, like, saying what the result is.
22:33
And then we'll say how matrix multiplication works and we'll see that it's true.
22:40
Okay. But maybe already I'm making --
22:45
I'm sort of bringing up -- the central idea of linear algebra is how these matrices work by rows as well as by columns.
22:55
Okay. How does it work by rows? What -- so that's a row vector.
23:05
I could say that's a one by three matrix, a row vector multiplying a three by three matrix.
23:11
What's the output?
23:17
What's the product of a row times a matrix?
23:23
And -- okay, it's a row. A row -- a column --
23:29
I'm sorry. A matrix times a column is a column. So matrix times a -- yeah.
23:35
Matrix times a column is a column.
23:41
And we know what column it is. Over here, I'm doing a row times a matrix.
23:47
And what's the answer? It's one of that first row, so it's 1 times --
23:53
1 times row one, plus 2 times row two plus 7 times row three.
24:05
When -- as we do matrix multiplication, keep your eye on what it's doing with whole vectors.
24:13
And what it's doing -- what it's doing in this case is it's combining the rows.
24:20
And we have a combination, a linear combination of the rows. Okay, I want to use that.
24:26
24:33
Okay, so my question is what's the matrix that does this first
24:38
step, that takes -- subtracts 3 of equation one from equation
24:44
two? That's what I want to do. So this is going to be a matrix that's going to subtract 3 times row one from row two,
25:03
and leaves the other rows the same. Just in -- I mean, the answer is going to be that.
25:09
So whatever matrix this is -- and you're going to, like, tell me what matrix will do it,
25:15
it's the matrix that leaves the first row unchanged, leaves the last row unchanged, but takes 3 of these
25:23
away from this so it puts a 0 there, a 2 there and a minus 2. Good.
25:29
What matrix will do it? It's these. It should be a pretty simple matrix,
25:35
because we're doing a very simple step. We're just doing this step that changes row two.
25:43
So actually, row one is not changing. So tell me how the matrix should begin.
25:51
One -- the first row of the matrix will be 1 0 0,
26:01
because that's just the right thing that takes one of that row and none of the other rows, and that's what we want.
26:08
What's the last row of the matrix? 0 0 1, because that takes one of the third row
26:17
and none of the other rows, that's great. Okay. Now, suppose I didn't want to do anything at all.
26:24
Suppose my row -- well, I guess maybe I had a case here when I already had a 0 and, didn't have to do anything.
26:33
What matrix does nothing, like, just leaves you where you were?
26:40
If I put in -- if I put in 0 1 0, that would be -- that would be --
26:49
that's the matrix -- what's the name of that matrix? The identity matrix, right.
26:55
So it does absolutely nothing. It just multiplies everything and leaves it where it is. It's like a one, like the number one, for matrices.
27:03
But that's not what we want, because we want to change this row to -- so what's the correct --
27:11
what should I put in here now to do it right?
27:16
I want to get -- what do I want? What I -- I'm after -- I want 3 of row one to get subtracted
27:24
off. So what's the right matrix, finish that matrix for me.
27:32
Negative 3 goes here? And what goes here? That 1.
27:38
And what goes here? The 0. That's the good matrix. That's the matrix that takes minus 3
27:46
of row one plus the row two and gives the new row 2. Should we just, like, check some particular
27:57
entry? How do I check a particular entry of a matrix in matrix multiplication?
28:03
Like, suppose I wanted to check the entry here that's in row
28:09
two, column three. So where does the entry in row two, column three come from?
28:16
I would look at row two of this guy and column three of this one to get that number.
28:26
That number comes from the second row and the third column and I just take this dot product minus 3 --
28:34
I'm multiplying -- minus 3 plus 1 and 0 gives the minus 2.
28:39
Yeah. It works. So we got various ways to multiply matrices now.
28:46
We're sort of, like -- informally. We've got by columns, we've got -- well,
28:52
we will have by columns, by rows, by each entry at a time. But it's good to see that matrix multiplication when one
29:01
of the matrices is so simple. So this guy is our elementary matrix.
29:08
Let's call it E for elementary or elimination. And let me put the indexes 2 1, because it's the matrix that we
29:18
needed to fix the 2 1 position. It's the matrix that we needed to get this 2 1
29:25
position to be Okay. Good enough. So what do I do next?
29:32
I need another matrix, right? I need to -- there's another step here.
29:39
And I want to express the whole elimination process in matrix language.
29:46
So tell me what -- so next step, step two, which was what?
29:54
Subtract -- what was -- what was the actual step that we did?
29:59
I think I subtracted -- do you remember? I had a 2 in the pivot and a 4 below it,
30:06
so I subtracted two times -- times row two from row three.
30:16
From row three. Tell me the matrix that will do that.
30:23
And tell me its name. Okay, it's going to be E, for elementary or elimination
30:31
matrix and what's the index number that I used to tell me what E --
30:38
3, 2, right? Because it's fixing this 3 2 position.
30:43
And what's the matrix, now? Okay, you remember -- so E 3 2 is supposed to multiply my guy
30:52
that I have and it's supposed to produce the right result,
30:58
which was -- it leaves -- it's supposed to leave the first row, it's supposed to leave the second row and it's supposed
31:05
to straighten out that third row to this.
31:10
And what's the matrix that does that?
31:15
1 0 0, right? Because we don't change the first row and the next row
31:21
we don't change either, and the last row is the one we do change.
31:27
And what do I do? Let's see, I subtract two times --
31:33
so what's this row? What's this here? 0, right, because the first row's not involved.
31:41
It's just in the 3 2 position, isn't it? This the key number is this minus the multiplier that goes
31:49
-- sitting there in that 3 2 position. Is it a minus 2 to subtract 2 and then this is a 1 so that --
31:59
the overall effect is to take minus 2 of this row plus 1 of
32:06
that. Okay. So, I've now given you the pieces, the elimination
32:15
matrices, the elementary matrices that take each step.
32:21
So now what? Now the next point in the lecture
32:27
is to put those steps together into a matrix that does it all and see how it all happens.
32:34
So now I'm going to express the whole -- everything we did today so far on A was to start with A,
32:46
we multiplied it by E 2 1, that was the first step --
32:53
and then we multiplied that result by E 3 2 and that led us
33:01
to this thing and what was that matrix? U.
33:10
You see why I like matrix notation, because there in, like, little space --
33:18
a few bits when its compressed on the web -- is everything -- is this whole lecture.
33:25
Okay. Now there -- there are important facts about matrix
33:33
multiplication. And we're close to maybe the most important.
33:40
And that is this. Suppose I ask you this question. Suppose I start with a matrix A and I
33:49
want to end with a matrix U and I want to say what matrix does the whole job?
33:55
What matrix takes me from A to U, using the letters I've got?
34:05
And the answer is simple. I'm not asking this as -- but it's highly important.
34:13
How would I create the matrix that
34:19
does the whole job at once, that does all of elimination in one shot?
34:24
It would be -- I would just put these together, right? In other words, this is the thing I'm struggling to say.
34:34
I can move those parentheses. If I keep the matrices in order --
34:41
I can't mess around with the order of the matrices, but I can change the order that I do the multiplications.
34:49
I can multiply these two first --
34:55
in other words, you see what those parentheses are doing? It's saying -- multiply the Es first and that gives you
35:04
the matrix that does everything at once. Okay. So this fact, that this is automatically the same as this
35:13
-- for every matrix multiplication, which I'm conscious of still
35:20
not telling you in every detail, but, like, you're seeing how it works -- and this is highly important --
35:27
and maybe tell me the long word that describes this law for matrices, that you can move the parentheses?
35:37
It's called the associative law. I think you can now forget that.
35:45
But don't forget the law. I mean, like, forget the word associative. I don't know. But don't forget the law.
35:51
Because actually, we'll see so many steps in linear algebra,
35:59
so many proofs, even, of main fact come from just moving the parentheses.
36:05
And it's not that easy to prove that this is correct,
36:15
you have to go into the gory details of matrix multiplication, do it both ways and see
36:20
that you come out the same. Maybe I'll leave the author to do that.
36:27
Okay. So there we go.
36:34
So there's a single matrix, I could call it E --
36:40
while we're talking about these matrices, tell me one other --
36:45
there's another type of elementary matrix, and we already said why we might need it.
36:52
We didn't need it in this case. But it's the matrix that exchanges two rows.
36:58
It's called a permutation matrix. Can you just, like, tell me what that would So I'm just -- like,
37:06
this is a slight digression and be? we'll -- yes, so let me get some -- let me figure out where I'm going
37:12
to put a permutation matrix. You'll see I'm always squeezing stuff in.
37:19
So permutation. Or, in fact this one you'll, like, exchange rows --
37:33
shall I exchange rows one and two, just to make life easy? So if I had my matrix -- no, let -- let me just do two by two.
37:41
|a b; c d|. Suppose I want to find the matrix that exchanges
37:49
those rows.
37:55
What is it? So the matrix that exchanges those rows --
38:01
the row I want is c d and it's there. So I better take one of it.
38:07
And the row I want here is up top, so I'll take one of that. So actually, I'm just --
38:13
the easy way -- this is my matrix that I'll call P, for permutation.
38:21
It's the matrix -- actually, the easy way to find it is just do
38:26
the thing to the identity matrix. Exchange the rows of the identity matrix
38:32
and then that's the matrix that will do row exchanges for you.
38:38
Suppose I wanted to exchange columns instead. Columns have hardly got into today's lecture,
38:45
but they certainly are going to be around. How could I -- if I started with this matrix |a b; c d|
38:53
then I wouldn't -- I'm not even going to write this down, I'm just going to ask you, because in elimination, we're
39:03
doing rows. But suppose we wanted to exchange the columns of a matrix.
39:10
How would I do that?
39:15
What matrix multiplication would do that job? Actually, why not? I'll write it down.
39:22
So this is -- I'll write it under here and then hide it again.
39:28
Okay. Suppose I had my matrix |a b; c d| and I want to get to a c over here and b d here.
39:38
39:44
What matrix does that job?
39:52
Can I multiply -- can I cook up some matrix that produces that
39:58
answer? You can see from where I put my hand I was really
40:04
asking can I put a matrix here on the left that
40:09
will exchange columns? And the answer is no.
40:16
I'm just bringing out again this point that when I multiply on the left, I'm doing row operations.
40:22
So if I want to do a column operation, where do I put that permutation matrix?
40:29
On the right. If I put it here, where I just barely left room for it --
40:35
so I'll exchange the two columns of the identity.
40:40
Then it comes out right, because now I'm multiplying a column at a time.
40:45
This is the first column and says take one -- take none of that column, one of this one and then you
40:52
got it. Over here, take one of this one, none of this one and you've got a c.
40:58
So, in short, to do column operations, the matrix multiplies on the right.
41:04
To do row operations, it multiplies on the left. Okay, okay, and it's row operations that we're really
41:11
doing. Okay.
41:18
And of course, I mentioned in passing, but I better say it very clearly that you can't exchange
41:30
the orders of matrices. And that's just the point I was making again here. A times B is not the same as B times A.
41:39
You have to keep these matrices in their Gauss given order
41:46
here, right? But you can move the parentheses,
41:52
so that, in other words, the commutative law, which would allow you to take it in the other order is false.
42:03
So we have to keep it in that order. Okay. So what next?
42:10
I could do this multiplication.
42:16
I could do E 32. So let me come back to see what that was.
42:24
Here was E 2 1. And here is E 3 2.
42:33
And if I multiply those two matrices together --
42:39
E 3 2 and then E 2 1, I'll get a single matrix that does elimination.
42:49
I don't want to do it that -- if I do that multiplication --
42:55
there -- there's a better way to do this.
43:00
And so in this last few minutes of today's lecture, can I anticipate that better way?
43:08
The better way is to think not how do I get from A to U,
43:15
but how do I get from U back to A?
43:20
So reversing steps is going to come in. Inverse -- I'll use the word inverse here.
43:28
Okay. So let me make the first step at what's the inverse matrix?
43:37
All the matrices you've seen on this board have inverses.
43:43
I didn't write any bad matrices down. We spoke about possible failure, and for a moment,
43:50
we put in a matrix that would fail. But right now, all these matrices are good,
43:56
they're all invertible. And let's take the inverse -- well, let me say first what does the inverse mean and find it?
44:04
Okay. So we're getting a little leg up on inverses.
44:10
Okay, so this is the final moments of today.
44:16
Sorry, he's still there.
44:22
Okay. Inverses.
44:31
Okay, and I'm just going to take one example and then we're done. The example I'll take will be that E. So my matrix
44:39
is 1 0 0 minus 3 1 0 0 0 1.
44:45
And I want to find the matrix that undoes that step.
44:55
So what was that step? The step was subtract 3 times row one from row two.
45:03
So what matrix will get me back?
45:10
What matrix will bring back -- you know, if I started with a 2 12 2 and I changed it to a 2 6
45:19
2 because of this guy, I want to get back to the 2 12 I want
45:25
to find the matrix which -- which undoes elimination, the matrix which multiplies this to give the identity.
45:33
45:38
And you can tell me what I should do in words first, and then we'll write down the matrix that does it.
45:45
If this step subtracted 3 times row 1 from row 2, what's the inverse step?
45:51
I add 3 times row one to row two, right?
46:02
I add it back. The -- what I subtracted away, I add back. So the inverse matrix in this case is --
46:08
I now want to add 3 times row one to row two, so I won't change row one, I won't change row three
46:17
and I'll add 3 times row one to row two.
46:23
That's a case where the inverse is clear. It's clear in words what to do, because what this did
46:33
was simple to express. It just changed row two by subtracting 3 of row one.
46:43
So to invert it, I go that way. And if you -- if we do that calculation, 3 times this row plus 1 times this row,
46:51
comes out the right row of the identity. Okay, so inverses are an --
46:57
so if this matrix was E and this matrix is I for identity, then
47:05
what's the notation for this guy? E to the minus one.
47:11
E inverse. Okay. Let's stop there for today.
47:16
That's a little jump on what's coming on Monday. So, see you Monday.
47:23
