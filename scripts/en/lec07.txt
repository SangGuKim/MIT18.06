# Intro
0:00
0:09
OK, here's linear algebra lecture seven. I've been talking about vector spaces
0:19
and specially the null space of a matrix and the column space of a matrix.
0:26
What's in those spaces. Now I want to actually describe them.
0:32
How do you describe all the vectors that are in those spaces? How do you compute these things?
0:39
So this is the, turning the idea, the definition,
0:46
into an algorithm. What's the algorithm for solving A x =0?
0:53
So that's the null space that I'm interested in. So can I take a particular matrix A and describe
1:01
the natural algorithm, and I'll execute it for that matrix --
1:06
here we go. So let me take the matrix as an example.
# Rectangular Matrix Example
1:12
So we're definitely talking rectangular matrices in this chapter. So I'll make, I'll have four columns.
1:22
And three rows. Two four six eight and three six eight ten.
1:29
OK.
1:36
If I just look at those columns, and rows, well,
# Elimination
1:42
I notice right away that column two is a multiple of column one.
1:47
It's in the same direction as column one. It's not independent. I'll expect to discover that in the process.
1:56
Actually, with rows, I notice that that row plus this row gives the third row.
2:03
So the third row is not independent. So, all that should come out of elimination.
2:12
So now what I -- my algorithm is elimination, but extended now
2:19
to the rectangular case, where we have to continue even if there's zeros in the pivot position,
2:30
we go on. OK, so let me execute elimination for that matrix.
2:36
My goal is always, while I'm doing elimination --
2:42
I'm not changing the null space. That's very important, right? I'm solving A x equals zero by elimination,
2:50
and when I do these operations that you already know, when I subtract a multiple of one
2:56
equation from another equation, I'm not changing the solutions.
3:02
So I'm not changing the null space. Actually, I changing the column space, as you'll see.
3:08
So you have to pay attention. What does elimination leave unchanged? And the answer is the solutions to the system are not changed
3:18
because I'm doing the same thing to -- I'm doing a legitimate operations on the equations.
3:24
Of course, on the right hand side it's always zero, and I don't plan to write zero all the time.
3:30
OK, so I'm really just working on the left side, but the right side is, is keeping up always zeros.
3:39
OK, so what's elimination? Well, you know where the first pivot is
3:44
and you know what to do with it. So can I just take the first step below here?
3:51
So that pivot row is fine. I take two times that row away from this one and I get zero
4:00
zero. That's signaling a difficulty. Two, two twos away from the six leaves me with a two.
4:07
Two twos away from the eight leaves me with a four. And now three of those away from here
4:13
is zero, again another zero, three twos away from that eight is the two, three twos away
4:20
from that ten is a four. OK. That's the first stage of elimination.
4:26
I've got the first column straight. So of course I move on to the second column.
4:35
I look in that position, I see a zero. I look below it, hoping for a non-zero
4:43
that I can do a row exchange. But it's zero below. So that's telling me that that column is -- well,
4:53
what it's really going to be telling me is that that column is a combination of the earlier columns.
4:59
It's that second column is dependent on the earlier columns. But I don't stop to think here.
5:09
In that column there's nothing to do. I go on to the next. So here's the next pivot.
5:15
So there's the first pivot and there's the second pivot, and I just keep this elimination going downwards.
5:22
So, so the next step keeps the first row,
5:30
keeps the second row with its pivot, so I've got my two pivots, and does elimination
5:40
to clear out the column below that pivot. So actually you see the multiplier is one.
5:47
It subtracts row two from row three and produces a row of zeros.
5:53
OK. That I would call that matrix U, right?
5:59
That's our upper -- well, I can't quite say upper triangular.
6:05
Maybe upper -- I don't know -- upper something.
6:12
It's in this so-called echelon form. The word echelon means, like, staircase form.
6:21
It's the, the non-zeros come in that staircase form. If there was another pivot here, then the staircase
6:30
would include that. But here's a case where we have two pivots only.
6:37
OK, so actually we've already discovered the most important number about this matrix.
6:44
The number of pivots is two. That number we will call the rank of the matrix.
# Rank
6:51
So let me put immediately. The rank of A --
6:58
so I'm telling you what this word rank means in the algorithm.
7:04
It's equal to the number of pivots. And in this case, two.
7:12
OK, for me that number two is the crucial number. OK, now I go to -- you remember I'm always solving A x equals
7:22
zero, but now I can solve U x equals zero, right? Same solution, same null space.
# Solution
7:29
OK. So I could stop here -- why don't I stop here and do the back substitution.
7:36
So now I have to ask you, how do I describe the solutions?
7:42
There are solutions, right, to A x equals zero. I knew there would be. I had three equations in four unknowns.
7:50
I certainly expected some solutions. Now I want to see what are they.
7:55
OK, here's the critical step. I refer to it up here as separating out
8:04
the pivot variables, the pivot columns, which are these two.
8:09
Here I have two pivot columns. Those, obviously, they're the columns with the pivots.
8:15
So I have two pivot columns.
8:22
And I have the other columns, I'll call free.
8:27
These are free columns, OK.
8:32
Why do I use those words? Why do I use that word free?
8:38
Because now I want to write, I want to find the solutions to U
8:43
x equals zero. Here is the way I do it. These free columns I can assign any number freely to those --
8:58
to the variables x2 and x4, the ones that multiply
9:03
columns two and four. So I can assign anything I like to x2 and x4.
9:10
And then I can solve the equations for x1 and x3.
9:17
Let me say that again. If I give -- let me, let me assign. So, so one particular x is to assign, say, the value one
9:29
to the, to x2, and zero to x4. Those are -- that was a free choice,
9:35
but it's a convenient choice. OK. Now I want to solve U x equals zero
9:41
and find numbers one and three, complete the solution.
9:47
Can I write down -- let's see. OK. Shall we just remember what U x equals zero represents?
9:53
What are my equations? That first equation is x1 plus just --
10:00
I'm just saying what are these matrices meaning. That's the first equation.
10:07
And the second equation was 2x3 + 4x4=0.
10:14
Those are my two equations. OK. Now the point is I can find x1 and x3 by back substitution.
10:24
So we're building on what we already know. The new thing is that there were some free variables that I
10:31
could give any numbers to. And I'm systematically going to make a choice like this, Now
10:38
what is x3? 1 and 0. Let's, let's go backwards, back up. I look at the last equation.
10:45
x3 is zero, from the last equation,
10:50
because, because x4 we've set x4 to zero,
10:55
and then we get x3 as zero. OK. Now we set x2 to be one, so what is x1?
11:03
Negative two, right? So then I have negative two plus two, zero and zero,
11:10
correctly giving zero. There is a vector in the null space. There is a solution to A x equals zero.
11:17
In fact, what solution is that? That simply says that minus two times the first column
11:24
plus one times the second column is the zero column. Of course that's right.
11:29
Minus two of that column plus one of that, or minus two of that plus one of that.
11:35
That solution is -- that, that's just what we saw immediately, that the second column is twice as big as the first column.
11:43
OK, tell me some more vectors in the null space. I found one.
11:51
Tell me, how to get a bunch more immediately out of that one.
11:58
Just take multiples of it. Any multiple of -- I could multiply this by anything.
12:04
I might as well call it, I could say, C, some multiple of this. So let me --
12:10
so X could be any multiple of this one. OK, that, that describes now a line,
12:17
an infinitely long line in four dimensional space.
12:23
But -- which is in the null space. Is that the whole null space?
12:29
No. I've got two free variables here. I made this choice, one and zero, for the free variables,
12:37
but I could have made another choice. Let me make the other choice zero and one.
12:44
You see my system. So let me repeat the system. This is the algorithm that you, you just learned to do.
12:54
Do elimination.
12:59
Decide which are the pivot columns and which are the free columns. That tells you that, that variables one and three
13:05
are pivot variables, two and four are free variables. Then those free variables, you assign them --
13:14
you give one of them the value one and the others the value zero -- in this case, we had a one and a zero --
13:22
and complete the solution. And you do -- you give the other one the value one and zero.
13:28
And now complete the solution. So let's complete that solution. I'm looking for a vector in the null space,
13:35
and it's absolutely going to be different from this guy, because, because any multiple of that zero
13:42
is never going to give the one. So I have somebody new in the null space, and let me finish it out.
13:47
What's x3 here? So we're going by back substitution, looking at this equation.
13:53
Now x4 we've changed, we're doing the other possibility,
13:59
where x2 is zero and x4 is one. So x3 will happen to be minus two.
14:06
And now what do I get for that first equation? x1 -- let's see.
14:12
Two x3s is minus four plus two -- do I get a two there?
14:19
Perhaps, yeah. Two for x1, minus four, and two.
14:25
OK. That's in the null space. What does that say about the columns?
14:32
That says that two of this column minus two
14:37
of this column plus this column gives zero, which it does. Two of that minus two of that and one of that
14:46
gives the zero column. OK, now, now I've found another vector in the null space.
14:52
Now we're ready to tell me the whole null space. What are all the solutions to Ax=0?
15:00
I've got this guy and when I have him,
Special Solutions
15:05
what else is, goes into the null space along with that? These are my two special solutions.
15:13
I call them special -- I just invented that name. Special solutions. What's special about them is the special numbers
15:21
I gave to the free variables, the values zero and one
15:27
for the free variables. I could have given the free variables any values
15:32
and got vectors in the null space. But this was a good way to be sure I got t- got everybody.
15:40
OK, so once I have him, I also have any multiple, right?
15:45
So I could take any multiple of that and it's in the null space.
15:50
And now what else -- I left a little space for what? What -- a plus sign.
15:58
I can take any combination. Here is a line of vectors in the null space.
16:04
A bunch of solutions. Would you rather I say in the null space or would you rather
16:09
I say, OK, I'm solving Ax=0? Well, really I'm solving Ux=0.
16:15
Well, OK, let me put in that crucial plus sign.
16:23
I'm taking all the combinations of my two special solutions.
16:29
That's my conclusion there. The null space contains, contains exactly
16:37
all the combinations of the special solutions. And how many special solutions are there?
16:46
There's one for every free variable. And how many free variables are there?
16:51
Oh, I mean, we can see all the whole picture now. If the rank R was two, this is the,
16:59
this is the number of pivot variables, right, because it counted the pivots.
17:05
So how many free variables?
17:11
Well, you know it's two, right? What is it in -- for a matrix that's m rows, n columns,
17:20
n variables that means, with rank r? How many free variables have we got left?
# Pivot Variables
17:28
If r of the variables are pivot variables, we have n-r --
17:34
in this case four minus two -- free variables. Do you see that first of all we get clean answers here?
17:53
We get r pivot variables -- so there really were r equations
17:59
here. There looked like three equations, but there were really only two independent equations.
18:05
And there were n-r variables that we could choose freely,
18:11
and we gave them those special zero one values, and we got the special solutions.
18:19
OK. For me -- we could stop at that point.
18:25
That gives you a complete algorithm for finding all the solutions to A x equals zero.
18:34
OK. Again, you do elimination --
18:41
going onward when a column, when there's nothing to be done on one column, you just continue.
18:50
There's this number r, the number of pivots, is crucial, and it leaves n-r free variables, which you
19:01
give values zero and one to. I would like to take one more step.
19:08
I would like to clean up this matrix even more. So now I'm going to go to -- this is in its,
19:14
this is in echelon form, upper triangular if you like.
19:20
I want to go one more step to make it as good as it can be.
#Matrix R
19:25
OK, so now I'm going to speak about the reduced row echelon
19:31
form. OK, so now I'm going to speak about the matrix R, which is the reduced row echelon form.
19:44
So what does that mean? That means I just -- I can, I can work harder on U.
19:52
So let me start, let me suppose I got as far as U, which was good.
19:58
20:08
Notice how that row of zeros appeared. I didn't comment on that, but I should have.
20:15
That row of zeros up here is because row three was
20:20
a combination of rows one and two, and elimination discovered that fact.
20:27
When we get a row of zeros, that's telling us that the --
20:32
original row that was there was a combination of other rows,
20:38
and elimination knocked it out. OK, so we got this far.
20:44
Now how can I clean that up further? I can do, elimination upwards.
20:51
I can get zero above the pivots. So this reduced row echelon form has zeros
20:58
above and below the pivots.
21:05
So let me do that.
21:11
So now I'll subtract one of this from the row above. That will leave a zero and a minus two in there.
21:20
And that's good.
21:26
OK, and I can clean it up even one more step. I can make the pivots --
21:33
the pivots I'm going to make equal to one, because I can divide equation two by the pivot.
21:41
That won't change the solutions. So let me do that. And then I really --
21:46
I'm ready to stop. One, two, zero, minus two, zero, zero, one, two.
21:53
I divided the second equation by two, because now I have a one in the pivot and zeros below.
22:05
OK. This is my matrix R.
22:14
I guess I'm hoping that you could now execute the whole algorithm.
22:21
Matlab will do it immediately with the command --
22:27
reduced row echelon form of A.
22:34
So if I input that original matrix A and then I write, then I type that command, press return,
22:43
that matrix will appear. That's the reduced row echelon form,
22:49
and it's got all the information as clear as can be.
23:00
What, what information has it got? Well, of course it immediately tells me the pivot rows, pivot rows, one and two,
23:08
pivot columns, one and three. And in fact it's got the identity matrix in there,
23:15
It's, it's got zeros above and below the pivots, right? and the pivots are one, so it's, so it's got a --
23:22
so notice the two by two identity matrix that's sitting
23:30
in the pivot rows and pivot columns. it's I in the pivot rows and columns.
23:42
It's got zero rows below.
23:48
Those are always indicating that original rows were,
23:56
were combinations of other rows. So we really only had two rows there.
24:02
And now it also -- so there's the identity. Now it's also got its free columns.
24:10
And, they're cleaned up as much as possible.
24:17
Actually, actually it's now so cleaned up that the special solutions, I can read off -- you remember I went through
24:26
the steps of computing this -- doing back substitution?
24:32
Let me, let me, instead of that system, let me take this improved system.
24:39
So I'm going to use these numbers, right. In these equations, what did I do?
24:45
I divided this equation by two and, oh yeah
24:52
and I had subtracted two of this, which knocked out this guy and made that a minus sign.
24:58
Is that what -- I've now written Rx equals zero.
25:04
25:10
Now I guess I'm hoping everybody in this room understands the solutions to the original A x equals zero,
25:19
the midway, halfway, U x equals zero, and the final R x equals zero are all the same.
25:27
Because going from one of those to another one I didn't mess up.
25:33
I just multiplied equations and subtracted from other equations, which I'm allowed to do.
25:39
OK. But my point is that now if I do this free variables
25:47
and back substitution, it's just, the numbers are there. When I let x -- so in this guy, I let x2 be one and x4 be zero.
26:01
I, I guess, what I seeing here? Let me, let me sort of separate this out here.
26:07
I'm seeing in the pivot, in the pivot columns,
26:12
if I, if I put the pivot columns here, I'm seeing those. And I'm -- in the free columns I'm seeing --
26:21
what I seeing in the free columns? A two, zero in that first free column, the x2 column,
26:29
and a minus two, two in the fourth column, the other free column.
26:36
And the row of zeros below, which of course have no --
26:41
that equation is zero equals zero. That's satisfied. Here's my point.
26:48
That when I do back substitution, these numbers are exactly what shows up --
26:55
oh, their signs get switched. I was going to say those numbers, two, minus two, zero,
27:01
two, can I just circle the -- this is the free part of the matrix.
27:07
This is the identity part. This is the free part, maybe I'll call it F.
27:14
This, of course, I call I, because it's the identity. The free part is a, I mean, I'm just doing back substitution.
27:25
And those free numbers will show up, with a minus sign, because they pop onto the other side of the equation --
27:32
so I see minus two, zero, and I see two, minus two.
27:39
So that wasn't magic. It had to happen. Let me, show you clearly why it happened.
27:48
OK, so that's -- this is what I'm interested in here.
27:53
And now let me, let me just, like, do it, do it for --
27:59
let's suppose we've, we've got to --
28:04
let's suppose we've got this system already in,
28:11
in rref form.
28:18
So my matrix R is -- what does it look like? OK, and I'll --
28:25
let me pretend that the pivot columns come first
28:30
and then whatever's in the free columns. And there might be some zero rows below.
28:37
There's a typical -- a pretty typical reduced row echelon form.
28:45
You see what's typical.
28:51
It's got -- this is r by r. This is r pivot rows.
28:57
This is r pivot columns.
29:06
And here are n-r free columns.
29:16
OK. Tell me what are the special solutions?
29:21
What are the -- what's x? If I want to solve R x equals zero --
29:27
in fact, let me -- I'm really going to, do the whole -- since these --
29:36
this is now block matrices, I might as well do all of the special solutions at once.
29:41
So I want to solve R x equals zero, and I'll have some special solutions.
29:49
Let me, actually -- can I do them all at once?
29:54
I'm going to create a null space matrix, OK.
30:00
A matrix. Its, its, its columns are the special --
30:13
the columns are the special solutions.
30:19
This is, I'm making it sound harder, it's going to be totally easy. N will be this null space matrix.
30:25
I want R N to be the zero matrix.
30:31
These columns of N are supposed to multipl- to get multiplied by R and give zero columns.
30:37
So what N will do the job? Let me put -- I'm going to put the identity in the free variable part
30:45
and then minus F will show up in the pivot variables, just
30:54
the way it did in that example. There we had the identity and F. Here -- in the special solution.
31:02
So these columns are -- there's the matrix of special solutions. And actually, there -- so there's a Matlab command
31:09
or a teaching code command, NULL -- N equal, so this is the --
31:19
produces the null basis, the null space matrix, NULL of A,
31:24
and there it is.
31:30
And how does that command actually work? It uses Matlab to compute R, then
31:38
it picks out the pivot variables, the free variables, puts, puts ones and zeros in for the free variables,
31:47
and copies out the pivot variables. It, it does back substitution, but back substitution
31:54
for this system is totally simple. What is this system?
32:00
R x equals zero. So this is R is I F, and x is the pivot variables
32:11
and the free variables, and it's supposed to give zero.
32:18
So what does that mean? That means that the pivot variables plus F
32:24
times the free variables give zero. So let me put F times the free variables on the other side.
32:31
I get minus F times the free variables.
32:37
There's my, equation, as simple as it can be.
32:43
That's what back substitution comes to when I've reduced and reduced and reduced this system
32:49
to the, to the best form, OK. And, then if the free variables, I
32:56
make this special choice of the identity, then the pivot variables are
33:02
minus F. OK, can I do, another example?
33:08
Could you do another example? Can I -- let me just take another matrix and, and let's go through this algorithm once more, OK.
33:17
Here we go. Here's a blackboard for another matrix, OK.
33:25
So I'll call the matrix A again, but let me make it --
33:31
yeah, how big shall we make it this time?
33:36
Why don't I do this? Just for the heck of it. Let me take the transpose of this A and see what happens to
33:44
that. Two four six eight and three six eight ten.
33:55
Before we do the calculations, tell me what's coming?
34:06
How many pivot variables do you expect here?
34:12
How many columns are going to have pivots? How many -- we have three columns in that matrix,
34:22
but are we going to, are we going to have three pivots? No, because this third columns is the sum of the first two
34:31
columns. I'm totally expecting, totally expecting that these will be
34:38
pivot columns -- because they're independent, but that this third guy,
34:45
the third column, which is dependent on the first two, is going to be a free column.
34:52
Elimination better discover that. And elimination will also straighten out
34:58
the rows, dependent rows and some independent rows.
35:05
What's the, what's the row reduced echelon form for this? Let's just do it, OK.
35:11
So, so that's the first pivot. Two times that away from that gives me a row of zeros.
35:20
Two times that away from that gives me a zero two two. And two times that away from that gives me a zero four four.
35:28
OK, first column is straight.
35:35
First variable is a pivot variable. No problem. On to the second column. I look at the second pivot, it's a zero.
35:43
I look below it. There's a two. OK, I do a row exchange.
35:50
So this zero is now there. I now have a perfectly good pivot, and I use it.
35:58
OK, and I subtract two of that row away from this row. All right if I do it like that?
36:05
I've got to the form U now. This was my A. Now there's my U. I can see now --
36:17
I have to stop, right? I would go on to the third column. I should have tried.
36:22
I quit, but without trying. I shouldn't have done that. On to the third column, look at the pivot position.
36:28
It's got a zero in it. Look below, all zeros. Now I'm entitled to stop, OK.
36:35
So the rank is two again.
36:45
What about the null space? How many special solutions are there this time?
36:52
How many special solutions for this matrix? I've got -- and which are the free variables and which are
# Pivot Columns
36:59
the pivot variables and so on? Pivot columns, I've got two pivot columns,
37:04
and that's no accident. The number of pivot columns for a matrix A, that's
37:11
a great fact, that the number of pivot columns for A and A transpose are the same.
37:19
And then I have a free column. There's a free column. One free column, because the count is three minus two.
37:30
Three minus two gives me one free column.
37:37
OK, so now let me solve, what's in the null space.
37:47
OK, so how do I -- let's see. These vectors have length three.
37:52
They only have three components. I'm making too much space for the, to write x.
37:58
x has just got three components, and what are they?
38:03
I'm looking for the null space.
38:09
OK, so how do I start? I give the free variable some convenient value.
38:17
And what's that? I set it to one.
38:23
I set the free variable to one. If I set the free variable to zero and solve
38:28
for the pivot variables, I'll get all zeros: no progress. But by setting the free variable to one --
38:36
you see w- my two equations now are -- my equations are x1+ 2x2+ 3 x3 is zero,
38:45
that's my first equation. And my second equation is now 2x2+2x3 equals zero.
38:51
And, OK. So if x3 is one, then x2 is minus one.
39:02
And if x3 is one and x2 is minus one, then maybe x1
39:07
is minus one. And actually I go back to check now.
39:14
I don't, like -- I did a quick calculation mentally.
39:19
Can I mentally do a quick check? That matrix, that solution x says that minus this column minus this column plus this one
# Null Space
39:28
is the zero column. And it is. Minus that minus that plus that is zero.
39:35
So that's in the null space. And now you can tell me what else is in the null space.
39:40
What's, what's the whole null space now? I multiply by C, right.
39:46
The whole null space is a line.
39:51
So that's the description. You know, if I ask you on a homework or a quiz or the final
39:57
what -- give me, describe, tell me the null space, find the null space of this matrix,
40:04
you can take those steps. And that's the answer I'm looking for.
40:10
And I'm looking for that C too, because that's telling me that you're remembering that it's a whole space and not
40:18
just one vector. Later I will ask you for a basis for the null space.
40:23
Then I just want this vector. But if I ask for the whole null space, then there's the whole line through that vector.
# Natural Solution
40:31
OK, now one more natural thing to do with this example, right, is keep going to the reduced matrix, R.
40:43
So can I push onwards to R? That should be quick, but let's just practice.
40:49
Let me keep going to R. OK, so what do I do here? I subtract --
40:55
I clear out above the pivot, so I subtract that from that, that's one zero one is left, right?
41:02
When I subtracted this row from this it produced a zero above this pivot. And now I want that pivot to be a one.
41:12
So for the R matrix, I'll divide this equation by two,
41:18
and of course these zero, zeros are great, they don't change.
41:23
There's R. That's R. You see what R is?
41:28
You see the identity matrix sitting up here? You see the free part F, the F part here?
41:36
And you see the zeros below. This is I F zero zero.
41:42
And what's the x? The x has the identity --
41:48
well, it's only a single number one, but it's the identity matrix in the free, in the free part.
41:56
And what does it have in the pivot variables? What did back substitution give?
42:03
It gave minus these guys. You see that what this is is any multiple of --
42:11
this is the identity there, and this is minus F here.
42:19
This is our null space matrix N for this.
42:24
Our, our null space matrix is the guy whose columns are the special solutions.
42:30
So their free variables have the special values one and, pivot variables have minus F.
42:39
So do you see, though, how the minus F just automatically shows up in the special solutions.
42:45
That's it really. I don't think there's anything more I
42:51
can say about A x equals zero. There's more I can say about A x equal b,
42:59
but that'll be on Friday. OK, so that's, that's the null space.
43:05
Thanks.
