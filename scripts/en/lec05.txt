# Intro
0:00
0:09
Okay. This is lecture five in linear algebra. And, it will complete this chapter of the book.
0:19
So the last section of this chapter
0:24
is two point seven that talks about permutations, which
0:30
finished the previous lecture, and transposes, which also came in the previous lecture.
0:36
There's a little more to do with those guys, permutations and transposes.
# Permutations
0:42
But then the heart of the lecture will be the beginning
0:48
of what you could say is the beginning of linear algebra, the beginning of real linear algebra which is seeing
0:57
a bigger picture with vector spaces -- not just vectors, but spaces of vectors and sub-spaces of those spaces.
1:06
So we're a little ahead of the syllabus, which is good, because we're coming to the place
1:13
where, there's a lot to do. Okay. So, to begin with permutations.
1:22
Can I just -- so these permutations, those are matrices P and they execute
1:36
row exchanges.
1:42
And we may need them. We may have a perfectly good matrix, a perfect matrix A that's invertible that we can solve A
1:52
x=b, but to do it -- I've got to allow myself that extra freedom
2:00
that if a zero shows up in the pivot position I move it away.
2:05
I get a non-zero. I get a proper pivot there by exchanging from a row below.
2:12
And you've seen that already, and I just want to collect the ideas together.
2:18
And principle, I could even have to do that two times, or more times.
2:24
So I have to allow -- to complete the -- the theory, the possibility that I take my matrix A,
2:34
I start elimination, I find out that I need row exchanges and I do it and continue and I finish.
2:41
Okay. Then all I want to do is say -- and I won't make a big project
2:49
out of this -- what happens to A equal L U?
2:54
So A equal L U --
2:59
this was a matrix L with ones on the diagonal and zeroes
3:05
above and multipliers below, and this U we know, with zeroes down here.
3:13
That's only possible.
3:19
That description of elimination assumes that we don't have a P, that we don't have any row exchanges.
3:26
And now I just want to say, okay, how do I account for row exchanges? Because that doesn't.
3:33
The P in this factorization is the identity matrix.
3:40
The rows were in a good order, we left them there. Maybe I'll just add a little moment of reality,
3:47
too, about how Matlab actually does elimination.
3:55
Matlab not only checks whether that pivot is not zero, as every human would do.
# Row Exchanges
4:02
It checks for is that pivot big enough, because it doesn't like very, very small pivots.
4:09
Pivots close to zero are numerically bad. So actually if we ask Matlab to solve a system,
4:16
it will do some elimination some row exchanges, which we don't think are necessary.
4:23
Algebra doesn't say they're necessary, but accuracy -- numerical accuracy says they are.
4:31
Well, we're doing algebra, so here we will say, well, what do row exchanges do,
4:39
but we won't do them unless we have to. But we may have to.
4:45
And then, the result is --
4:50
it's hiding here. It's the main fact.
4:56
This is the description of elimination with row exchanges. So A equal L U becomes P A equal L U.
5:12
So this P is the matrix that does the row exchanges, and actually it does them --
5:18
it gets the rows into the right order, into the good order where pivots will not --
5:23
where zeroes won't appear in the pivot position, where L and U will come out right as up here.
5:32
So, that's the point. Actually, I don't want to labor that point,
# Permutation Matrix
5:39
that a permutation matrix -- and you remember what those were.
5:47
I'll remind you from last time of what the main points about permutation matrices were --
5:57
and then just leave this factorization as the general case.
6:03
This is -- any invertible A we get this.
6:17
For almost every one, we don't need a P. But there's that handful that do need row exchanges,
6:24
and if we do need them, there they are. Okay, finally, just to remember what P was.
6:30
So permutations, P is the identity matrix
6:46
with reordered rows.
6:51
6:56
I include in reordering the possibility that you just leave them the same. So the identity matrix is -- okay.
7:02
That's, like, your basic permutation matrix --
7:08
your do-nothing permutation matrix is the identity. And then there are the ones that exchange two rows and then
7:15
the ones that exchange three rows and then then ones that exchange four --
7:21
well, it gets a little -- it gets more interesting algebraically
7:27
if you've got four rows, you might exchange them all in one big cycle. One to two, two to three, three to four, four to one.
7:35
Or you might have -- exchange one and two and three and four.
7:41
Lots of possibilities there. In fact, how many possibilities?
7:46
The answer was (n)factorial. This is n(n-1)(n-2)...
7:56
(3)(2)(1). That's the number of -- this counts the reorderings,
8:05
the possible reorderings. So it counts all the n by n permutations.
8:15
8:23
And all those matrices have these -- have this nice property that they're all invertible,
8:32
because we can bring those rows back into the normal order.
8:39
And the matrix that does that is just P -- is just the same as the transpose.
8:46
You might take a permutation matrix, multiply by its transpose and you will see how --
8:51
that the ones hit the ones and give the ones in the identity
8:57
matrix. So this is a -- we'll be highly interested in matrices
9:02
that have nice properties. And one property that -- maybe I could rewrite that as P
9:09
transpose P is the identity. That tells me in other words that this
9:16
is the inverse of that. Okay. We'll be interested in matrices that have P transpose
9:25
P equal the identity. There are more of them than just permutations, but my point right now is that permutations are like a little
9:35
group in the middle -- in the center of these special matrices.
9:42
Okay. So now we know how many there are.
9:47
Twenty four in the case of -- there are twenty four four by four permutations, there are five factorial which is
9:55
a hundred and twenty, five times twenty four would bump us up to a hundred and twenty -- so listing all the five by five
10:03
permutations would be not so much fun.
# Transpose Matrix
10:09
Okay. So that's permutations.
10:15
Now also in section two seven is some discussion of transposes.
10:20
And can I just complete that discussion. First of all, I haven't even transposed a matrix
10:30
on the board here, have I? So I'd better do it. So suppose I take a matrix like (1 2 4; 3 3 1).
10:39
It's a rectangular matrix, three by two.
10:47
And I want to transpose it. So what's --
10:53
I'll use a T, also Matlab would use a prime.
10:59
And the result will be -- I'll right it here, because this was three rows and two columns,
11:07
this was a three by two matrix. The transpose will be two rows and three columns,
11:13
two by three. So it's short and wider.
11:20
And, of course, that row -- that column becomes a row --
11:25
that column becomes the other row. And at the same time, that row became a column.
11:36
This row became a column. Oh, what's the general formula for the transpose?
11:41
So the transpose --
11:48
you see it in numbers. What I'm going to write is the same thing in symbols.
11:54
The numbers are the clearest, of course. But in symbols, if I take A transpose
12:04
and I ask what number is in row I and column J of A transpose?
12:10
Well, it came out of A.
12:16
It came out A by this flip across the main diagonal.
12:22
And, actually, it was the number in A
12:28
which was in row J, column I.
12:34
So the row and column -- the row and column numbers just get reversed.
12:39
The row number becomes the column number, the column number becomes the row number. No problem.
12:45
Okay. Now, a special -- the best matrices, we could say.
12:52
In a lot of applications, symmetric matrices show up.
12:58
So can I just call attention to symmetric matrices?
13:07
What does that mean? What does that word symmetric mean? It means that this transposing doesn't change the matrix.
13:16
A transpose equals A. And an example.
13:21
So, let's take a matrix that's symmetric,
13:29
so whatever is sitting on the diagonal -- but now what's above the diagonal, like a one,
13:36
had better be there, a seven had better be here, a nine had better be there.
13:43
There's a symmetric matrix. I happened to use all positive numbers as its entries.
13:52
That's not the point. The point is that if I transpose that matrix, I get it back again.
13:58
So symmetric matrices have this property A transpose equals A. I guess at this point --
14:07
I'm just asking you to notice this family of matrices that
14:14
are unchanged by transposing. And they're easy to identify, of course.
14:22
You know, it's not maybe so easy before we had a case where
14:28
the transpose gave the inverse. That's highly important, but not so simple to see.
14:36
This is the case where the transpose gives the same matrix back again. That's totally simple to see.
14:42
Okay. Could actually -- maybe I could even say when would we get such
14:49
a matrix? For example, this -- that matrix is absolutely far from
14:55
symmetric, right? The transpose isn't even the same shape --
15:01
because it's rectangular, it turns the -- lies down on its side.
15:06
But let me tell you a way to get a symmetric matrix out of this.
15:11
Multiply those together. If I multiply this rectangular, shall I
15:17
call it R for rectangular? So let that be R for rectangular matrix
15:22
and let that be R transpose, which it is. Then I think that if I multiply those together,
15:32
I get a symmetric matrix. Can I just do it with the numbers and then ask you why, how did I know it would be symmetric?
15:44
So my point is that R transpose R is always symmetric.
15:52
Okay?
15:57
And I'm going to do it for that particular R transpose R which was --
16:02
let's see, the column was one two four three three one.
16:09
I called that one R transpose, didn't I, and I called this guy one two four three three one.
16:16
I called that R. Shall we just do that multiplication? Okay, so up here I'm getting a ten.
16:22
Next to it I'm getting two, a nine, I'm getting an eleven. Next to that I'm getting four and three, a seven.
16:30
Now what do I get there? This eleven came from one three times two three, right?
16:37
Row one, column two. What goes here? Row two, column one.
16:43
But no difference. One three two three or two three one three, same thing.
16:50
It's going to be an eleven. That's the symmetry. I can continue to fill it out.
16:56
What -- oh, let's get that seven. That seven will show up down here, too, and then four more numbers.
17:02
That seven will show up here because one three times four one gave the seven, but also four one times one three
17:10
will give that seven. Do you see that it works?
17:16
Actually, do you want to see it work also in matrix language?
17:24
I mean, that's quite convincing, right? That seven is no accident.
17:29
The eleven is no accident.
17:35
But just tell me how do I know if I transpose this guy --
17:40
How do I know it's symmetric? Well, I'm going to transpose it. And when I transpose it, I'm hoping
17:49
I get the matrix back again. So can I transpose R transpose R?
17:54
So just -- so, why?
17:59
Well, my suggestion is take the transpose.
18:09
That's the only way to show it's symmetric. Take the transpose and see that it didn't change. Okay, so I take the transpose of R transpose R.
18:19
Okay. How do I do that? This is our little practice on the rules for transposes.
18:27
So the rule for transposes is the order gets reversed.
18:33
Just like inverses, which we did prove, same rule for transposes and -- which we'll now use.
# Transpose Rule
18:44
So the order gets reversed. It's the transpose of that that comes first,
18:51
and the transpose of this that comes -- no.
18:56
Is that -- yeah. That's what I have to write, right? This is a product of two matrices and I want its
19:03
transpose. So I put the matrices in the opposite order and I transpose them. But what have I got here?
19:09
What is R transpose transpose?
19:15
Well, don't all speak at once. R transpose transpose, I flipped over the diagonal,
19:22
I flipped over the diagonal again, so I've got R.
19:28
And that's just my point, that if I started with this matrix, I transposed it, I got it back again.
19:34
So that's the check, without using numbers, but with --
19:46
it checked in two lines that I always get symmetric matrices
19:52
this way. And actually, that's where they come from in so many practical applications.
20:00
Okay. So now I've said something today about permutations and about
20:07
transposes and about symmetry and I'm ready
20:14
for chapter three. Can we take a breath --
20:21
the tape won't take a breath, but the lecturer will, because to tell you about vector spaces is --
20:31
we really have to start now and think, okay, listen up.
20:38
What are vector spaces?
# Vector Spaces
20:47
And what are sub-spaces? Okay. So, the point is, The main operations that we do --
21:01
what do we do with vectors? We add them. We know how to add two vectors.
21:07
We multiply them by numbers, usually called scalers.
21:13
If we have a vector, we know what three V is. If we have a vector V and W, we know what V plus W is.
21:24
Those are the two operations that we've got to be able to do.
21:29
To legitimately talk about a space of vectors, the requirement is that we should
21:35
be able to add the things and multiply by numbers and that there should be some decent rules satisfied.
21:44
Okay. So let me start with examples. So I'm talking now about vector spaces.
21:50
21:56
And I'm going to start with examples.
22:06
Let me say again what this word space is meaning. When I say that word space, that means to me
22:14
that I've got a bunch of vectors, a space of vectors.
22:19
But not just any bunch of vectors. It has to be a space of vectors --
22:28
has to allow me to do the operations that vectors are for. I have to be able to add vectors and multiply by numbers.
22:37
I have to be able to take linear combinations. Well, where did we meet linear combinations?
22:43
We met them back in, say in R^2.
22:48
So there's a vector space. What's that vector space?
22:54
So R two is telling me I'm talking about real numbers
22:59
and I'm talking about two real numbers. So this is all two dimensional vectors --
23:11
real, such as --
23:16
well, I'm not going to be able to list them all. But let me put a few down. |3; 2|, |0;0|, |pi; e|.
23:30
So on.
23:35
And it's natural -- okay. Let's see, I guess I should do algebra first.
23:44
Algebra means what can I do to these vectors? I can add them. I can add that to that.
23:50
And how do I do it? A component at a time, of course. Three two added to zero zero gives me, three two.
23:58
Sorry about that. Three two added to pi e gives me three plus pi, two plus e.
24:05
Oh, you know what it does. And you know the picture that goes with it.
24:11
There's the vector three two. And often, the picture has an arrow.
24:19
The vector zero zero, which is a highly important vector -- it's got, like, the most important here
24:24
-- is there. And of course there's not much of an arrow.
24:29
Pi -- I'll have to remember -- pi is about three and a little
24:35
more, e is about two and a little more. So maybe there's pi e.
24:41
I never drew pi e before. It's just natural to --
24:47
this is the first component on the horizontal
24:55
and this is the second component, going up the vertical.
25:02
Okay. And the whole plane is R two.
25:07
So R two is, we could say, the plane.
25:14
The xy plane. That's what everybody thinks.
25:24
But the point is it's a vector space because all those vectors
25:32
are in there. If I removed one of them -- Suppose I removed zero zero.
25:39
Suppose I tried to take the -- considered the X Y plane with a puncture, with a point removed.
25:46
Like the origin. That would be, like, awful to take the origin away. Why is that?
25:52
Why do I need the origin there? Because I have to be allowed -- if I had these other vectors,
25:59
I have to be allowed to multiply three two -- this was three two --
26:05
by anything, by any scaler, including zero. I've got to be allowed to multiply by zero
26:12
and the result's got to be there. I can't do without that point.
26:18
And I have to be able to add three two to the opposite guy,
26:23
minus three minus two. And if I add those I'm back to the origin again.
26:29
No way I can do without the origin. Every vector space has got that zero vector in it.
26:36
Okay, that's an easy vector space, because we have a natural picture of it.
26:42
Okay. Similarly easy is R^3.
26:50
This would be all -- let me go up a little here. This would be --
26:57
R three would be all three dimensional vectors -- or shall I say vectors with three real components.
27:09
Okay.
27:15
Let me just to be sure we're together,
27:21
let me take the vector three two zero.
27:29
Is that a vector in R^2 or R^3? Definitely it's in R^3.
27:38
It's got three components. One of them happens to be zero, but that's a perfectly okay number.
27:43
So that's a vector in R^3. We don't want to mix up the --
27:51
I mean, keep these vectors straight and keep R^n straight. So what's R^n?
27:57
R^n. So this is our big example, is all vectors with n components.
28:05
And I'm making these darn things column vectors.
28:11
Can I try to follow that convention, that they'll be column vectors, and their components should
28:17
be real numbers. Later we'll need complex numbers and complex vectors,
28:24
but much later. Okay. So that's a vector space.
28:31
Now, let's see. What do I have to tell you about vector spaces? I said the most important thing, which is that we can add any
28:44
two of these and we -- still in R^2. We can multiply by any number and we're still in R^2.
28:50
We can take any combination and we're still in R^2. And same goes for R^n.
28:55
It's -- honesty requires me to mention that these operations
# Rules
29:02
of adding and multiplying have to obey a few rules.
29:08
Like, we can't just arbitrarily say, okay, the sum of three two and pi e is zero zero.
29:15
It's not. The sum of three two and minus three two is zero zero.
29:22
So -- oh, I'm not going to -- the book, actually, lists the eight rules that the addition and multiplication
29:32
have to satisfy, but they do. They certainly satisfy it in R^n and usually it's not those
29:38
eight rules that are in doubt. What's -- the question is, can we do those additions and do we
29:50
stay in the space? Let me show you a case where you can't.
29:55
So suppose this is going to be not a vector space.
30:05
Suppose I take the xy plane -- so there's R^2. That is a vector space.
30:11
Now suppose I just take part of it. Just this.
30:17
Just this one -- this is one quarter of the vector space.
30:24
All the vectors with positive or at least not negative
30:29
components. Can I add those safely?
# Subspace
30:37
Yes. If I add a vector with, like, two -- three two to another vector like five six,
30:45
I'm still up in this quarter, no problem with adding. But there's a heck of a problem with multiplying by scalers,
30:54
because there's a lot of scalers that will take me out of this quarter plane, like negative ones.
31:02
If I took three two and I multiplied by minus five, I'm way down here.
31:08
So that's not a vector space, because it's not -- closed is the right word.
31:14
It's not closed under multiplication by all real numbers.
31:19
So a vector space has to be closed under multiplication
31:27
and addition of vectors. In other words, linear combinations. It -- so, it means that if I give you a few vectors --
31:37
yeah look, here's an important -- here -- now we're getting to some really important vector spaces. Well, R^n -- like, they are the most important.
31:47
But we will be interested in so- in vector spaces that are
31:52
inside R^n. Vector spaces that follow the rules, but they --
32:01
we don't need all of -- see, there we started with R^2 here,
32:10
and took part of it and messed it up. What we got was not a vector space.
32:17
Now tell me a vector space that is part of R^2 and is still
32:25
safely -- we can multiply, we can add and we stay in this
32:31
smaller vector space. So it's going to be called a subspace. So I'm going to change this bad example to a good one.
32:40
Okay. So I'm going to start again with R^2, but I'm going to take an example -- it is a vector space,
32:50
so it'll be a vector space inside R^2.
32:56
And we'll call that a subspace of R^2.
33:03
Okay. What can I do?
33:09
It's got something in it. Suppose it's got this vector in it.
33:14
Okay. If that vector's in my little subspace
33:19
and it's a true subspace, then there's got to be some more in it,
33:24
right? I have to be able to multiply that by two, and that double vector has to be included.
33:33
Have to be able to multiply by zero, that vector, or by half, or by three quarters.
33:39
All these vectors. Or by minus a half, or by minus one.
33:44
I have to be able to multiply by any number. So that is going to say that I have to have that whole line.
33:52
Do you see that? Once I get a vector in there --
33:58
I've got the whole line of all multiples of that vector. I can't have a vector space without extending to get
34:09
those multiples in there. Now I still have to check addition.
34:15
But that comes out okay. This line is going to work, because I could add something
34:20
on the line to something else on the line and I'm still on the line.
34:26
So, example. So this is all examples of a subspace --
34:33
our example is a line in R^2 actually -- not just any line.
34:45
If I took this line, would that --
34:50
so all the vectors on that line. So that vector and that vector and this vector and this vector
34:56
-- in lighter type, I'm drawing something that doesn't work.
35:05
It's not a subspace. The line in R^2 -- to be a subspace, the line in R^2 must go through the zero vector.
35:15
Because -- why is this line no good?
35:21
Let me do a dashed line.
35:27
Because if I multiplied that vector on the dashed line by zero, then I'm down here, I'm not on the dashed line.
35:34
Z- zero's got to be. Every subspace has got to contain zero --
35:39
because I must be allowed to multiply by zero and that will always give me the zero vector.
35:46
Okay. Now, I was going to make --
35:51
create some subspaces. Oh, while I'm in R^2, why don't we think of all
35:59
the possibilities. R two, there can't be that many. So what are the possible subspaces of R^2?
36:07
Let me list them. So I'm listing now the subspaces of R^2.
36:16
And one possibility that we always allow
36:23
is all of R two, the whole thing, the whole space.
36:29
That counts as a subspace of itself. You always want to allow that.
# Lines
36:35
Then the others are lines -- any line, meaning infinitely far in both directions
36:45
through the zero.
36:55
So that's like the whole space -- that's like whole two D space.
37:00
This is like one dimension. Is this line the same as R^1 ? No.
37:07
You could say it looks a lot like R^1. R^1 was just a line and this is a line.
37:14
But this is a line inside R^2. The vectors here have two components.
37:20
So that's not the same as R^1, because there the vectors only have one component.
37:25
Very close, you could say, but not the same. Okay. And now there's a third possibility.
37:32
There's a third subspace that's --
37:40
of R^2 that's not the whole thing, and it's not a line.
37:47
It's even less. It's just the zero vector alone. The zero vector alone, only.
37:55
38:01
I'll often call this subspace Z, just for zero. Here's a line, L.
38:07
Here's a plane, all of R^2. So, do you see that the zero vector's okay?
38:14
You would just -- to understand subspaces, we have to know the rules -- and knowing the rules means that we
38:20
have to see that yes, the zero vector by itself, just this guy alone satisfies the rules.
38:27
Why's that? Oh, it's too dumb to tell you. If I took that and added it to itself, I'm still there.
38:36
If I took that and multiplied by seventeen, I'm still there. So I've done the operations, adding and multiplying
38:44
by numbers, that are required, and I didn't go outside this one point space.
38:50
So that's always -- that's the littlest subspace.
38:57
And the largest subspace is the whole thing and in-between come all --
39:02
whatever's in between. Okay. So for example, what's in between for R^3?
39:07
So if I'm in ordinary three dimensions, the subspace is R, all of R^3 at one extreme, the zero vector at the bottom.
39:18
And then a plane, a plane through the origin.
39:23
Or a line, a line through the origin. So with R^3, the subspaces were R^3, plane through the origin,
39:32
line through the origin and a zero vector by itself, zero zero zero, just that single vector.
39:43
Okay, you've got the idea. But, now comes --
# Subspaces
39:51
the reality is -- what are these -- where do these subspaces come --
39:57
how do they come out of matrices? And I want to take this matrix --
40:06
oh, let me take that matrix. So I want to create some subspaces out of that matrix.
40:17
Well, one subspace is from the columns.
40:26
Okay. So this is the important subspace,
40:34
the first important subspace that comes from that matrix -- I'm going to -- let me call it A again.
40:40
Back to -- okay. I'm looking at the columns of A.
40:48
Those are vectors in R^3. So the columns are in R^3. The columns are in R^3.
40:58
So I want those columns to be in my subspace.
41:04
Now I can't just put two columns in my subspace
41:11
and call it a subspace. What do I have to throw in -- if I'm going to put those two
41:16
columns in, what else has got to be there to have a subspace? I must be able to add those things.
41:25
So the sum of those columns -- so these columns are in R^3, and I have to be able --
41:34
I'm, you know, I want that to be in my subspace, I want that to be in my subspace, but therefore I have to be able to multiply them by anything.
41:42
Zero zero zero has got to be in my subspace. I have to be able to add them so that four five five
41:48
is in the subspace. I've got to be able to add one of these plus three of these. That'll give me some other vector.
41:54
I have to be able to take all the linear combinations.
42:02
So these are columns in R^3 and all there linear combinations
42:14
form a subspace.
42:21
What do I mean by linear combinations? I mean multiply that by something, multiply that by something and add.
42:28
The two operations of linear algebra, multiplying by numbers
42:33
and adding vectors. And, if I include all the results,
42:38
then I'm guaranteed to have a subspace. I've done the job.
42:46
And we'll give it a name -- the column space.
42:53
Column space.
43:01
And maybe I'll call it C of A. C for column space.
43:07
There's an idea there that --
43:15
Like, the central idea for today's lecture is --
43:22
got a few vectors. Not satisfied with a few vectors, we want a space of vectors.
43:29
The vectors, they're in -- these vectors in -- are in R^3 , so our space of vectors will be vectors in R^3.
43:37
The key idea's -- we have to be able to take their combinations.
43:42
So tell me, geometrically, if I drew all these things -- like if I drew one two four, that would be somewhere maybe
43:50
there. If I drew three three one, who knows, might be -- I don't know, I'll say there.
43:57
There's column one, there's column two. What else -- what's in the whole column space?
44:06
How do I draw the whole column space now? I take all combinations of those two vectors.
44:13
Do I get -- well, I guess I actually listed the possibilities.
44:19
Do I get the whole space? Do I get a plane?
44:24
I get more than a line, that's for sure. And I certainly get more than the zero vector, but I do get the zero vector included.
44:31
What do I get if I combine -- take all the combinations of two vectors in R^3 ?
44:39
So I've got all this stuff on --
44:46
that whole line gets filled out, that whole line gets filled out, but all in-between gets filled out -- between the two lines because I --
44:52
I allowed to add something from one line, something from the other. You see what's coming?
44:58
I'm getting a plane.
45:05
That's my -- and it's through the origin.
45:10
Those two vectors, namely one two four and three three one,
45:17
when I take all their combinations, I fill out a whole plane. Please think about that.
45:25
That's the picture you have to see. You sure have to see it in R^3 , because we're going to do it
45:31
in R^10, and we may take a combination of five vectors in R^10, and what will we have?
45:40
God knows. It's some subspace. We'll have five vectors.
45:46
They'll all have ten components. We take their combinations.
45:52
We don't have R^5 , because our vectors have ten components.
45:58
And we possibly have, like, some five dimensional flat thing
46:05
going through the origin for sure. Well, of course, if those five vectors were all on the line,
46:12
then we would only get that line. So, you see, there are, like, other possibilities here. It depends what -- it depends on those five vectors.
46:21
Just like if our two columns had been on the same line, then the column space would have been only a line.
46:28
Here it was a plane. Okay.
46:35
I'm going to stop at that point. That's the central idea of -- the great example of how
46:44
to create a subspace from a matrix. Take its columns, take their combinations,
46:51
all their linear combinations and you get the column space.
46:57
And that's the central sort of -- we're looking at linear algebra at a higher level.
47:04
When I look at A -- now, I want to look at Ax=b. That'll be the first thing in the next lecture.
47:10
How do I understand Ax=b in this language --
47:17
in this new language of vector spaces and column spaces.
47:22
And what are other subspaces? So the column space is a big one, there are others to come.
47:30
Okay, thanks.
