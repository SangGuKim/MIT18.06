OK, this is quiz review day. The quiz coming up on Wednesday will before this
0:17
lecture the quiz will be this hour one o'clock Wednesday in Walker, top floor of Walker, closed book, all normal.
0:27
I wrote down what we've covered in this second part
0:33
of the course, and actually I'm impressed as I write it.
0:38
so that's chapter four on orthogonality and you're remembering these --
0:45
what this is suggesting, these are those columns are orthonormal vectors, and then we call that matrix Q and the --
0:56
what's the key -- how do we state the fact that those v- those columns are orthonormal in terms of Q,
1:04
it means that Q transpose Q is the identity.
1:11
So that's the matrix statement of the -- of the property that the columns are orthonormal,
1:18
the dot products are either one or zero, and then we computed the projections onto lines and onto
1:30
subspaces, and we used that to solve problems Ax=b in --
1:35
in the least square sense, when there was no solution, we found the best solution. And then finally this Graham-Schmidt idea,
1:43
which takes independent vectors and lines them up, takes --
1:50
subtracts off the projections of the part you've already done, so that the new part is orthogonal
1:58
and so it takes a basis to an orthonormal basis.
2:03
And you -- those calculations involve square roots a lot because you're making things unit vectors,
2:11
but you should know that step. OK, for determinants, the three big --
2:16
the big picture is the properties of the determinant, one to three d- properties one, two and three, d-
2:24
that define the determinant, and then four, five, six through ten were consequences.
2:31
Then the big formula that has n factorial terms, half of them have plus signs and half minus signs, and then
2:38
the cofactor formula. So and which led us to a formula for the inverse.
2:46
And finally, just so you know what's covered in from chapter three, it's section six point
2:53
one and two, so that's the basic idea of eigenvalues
2:58
and eigenvectors, the equation for the eigenvalues, the mechanical step, this is really Ax equal lambda
3:07
x for all n eigenvectors at once, if we have n independent eigenvectors,
3:14
and then using that to compute powers of a matrix. So you notice the differential equations not on this list,
3:22
because that's six point three, that that's for the third quiz.
3:28
OK. Shall I what I usually do for review is to take an old exam
3:36
and just try to pick out questions that are significant and write them quickly on the board, shall I --
3:44
shall I proceed that way again? This -- this exam is really old.
3:51
November nineteen -- nineteen eighty-four, so that was before the Web existed.
3:59
So not only were the lectures not on the Web, nobody even had a Web page, my God.
4:07
OK, so can I nevertheless linear algebra was still as great as ever.
4:14
So may I and that wasn't meant to be a joke, OK, all right,
4:22
so let me just take these questions as they come.
4:28
All right. OK. So the first question's about projections. It says we're given the line, the --
4:35
the vector a is the vector two, one, two, and I want to find the projection matrix P that
4:44
projects onto the line through a. So my picture is, well I'm in three dimensions, of course,
4:51
so there's a vector, two -- there's the vector a, two, one, two, let me draw the whole line through it,
4:59
and I want to project any vector b onto that line,
5:05
and I'm looking for the projection matrix. So -- so this -- the projection matrix is the matrix that I
5:12
multiply b by to get here. And I guess this first part, this is just part one
5:19
a, I'm really asking you the -- the quick way to answer, to find P, is just to remember what the formula is.
5:28
And -- and we're in -- we're projecting onto a line, so our formula, our -- our usual formula is AA transpose A
5:37
inverse A transpose, but now A is just a column,
5:43
one-column matrix, so it'll be just a, so I'll just call it
5:49
little a, little a transpose, and this is just a number now, one by one, so I can put it in the denominator,
5:56
so there's our -- that's really what we want to remember, and -- and using that two, one, two, what will I get?
6:05
I'm dividing by -- what's the length squared of that vector?
6:12
So what's a transpose a? Looks like nine, and what's the matrix, well, I'm --
6:18
I'm doing two, one, two against two, one, two, so it's one-ninth of this matrix four, two, four,
6:28
two, one, two, four, two, four.
6:34
Now the next part asked about eigenvalues. So you see we're -- since we're learning,
6:39
we know a lot more now, we can make connections between these chapters, so what's the eigenvector,
6:47
what are the eigenvalues of P? I could ask what's the rank of P. What's
6:53
the rank of that matrix? Uh -- one. Rank is one.
6:59
What's the column space? If I apply P to all vectors then I fill up the column space,
7:06
it's combinations of the columns, so what's the column space? Well, it's just this line.
7:13
The column space is the line through two, one, two. And now what's the eigenvalue?
7:20
So, or since that matrix has rank one, so tell me the eigenvalues of this matrix.
7:26
It's a singular matrix, so it certainly has an eigenvalue zero.
7:34
Actually, the rank is only one, so that means that there like going to be
7:42
t- a two-dimensional null space, there'll be at least two,
7:48
this lambda equals zero will be repeated twice because I can find two independent eigenvectors
7:55
with lambda equals zero, and then of course since it's got three eigenvalues, what's the third one?
8:02
It's one. How do I know it's one? Either from the trace, which is nine over nine, which is one,
8:09
or by remembering what -- what is the eigenvector, and actually now
8:16
it's going to ask for the eigenvector, so what's the eigenvector for that eigenvalue?
8:21
What's the eigenvector for that eigenvalue?
8:28
It's the -- it's the vector that doesn't move, eigenvalue one,
8:35
so the vector that doesn't move is a. This a is the --
8:41
is -- is also the eigenvector with lambda equal one,
8:47
because if I apply the projection matrix to a, I get a again.
8:52
Everybody sees that if I apply that matrix to a, can I do it in little letters, if I apply that matrix to a,
8:59
then I have a transpose a canceling a transpose a and I get a again. So sure enough, Pa equals a.
9:06
And the eigenvalue is one.
9:12
OK. Good. now, actually it asks you further to solve this
9:22
difference equation, so this will be -- this is -- this is solve u(k+1)=Puk, starting from u0 equal nine,
9:36
nine, zero. And find uk.
9:41
So -- so what's up?
9:49
Shall we find u1 first of all? So just to get started.
9:55
So what is u1? It's Pu0 of course.
10:01
So if I do the projection of -- of this vector onto the line, so this is like my vector b now
10:10
that I'm projecting onto the line, I get a times a transpose u0 over a transpose a.
10:19
Well, one way or another I just do this multiplication. but maybe this is the easiest way to do it.
10:26
a transpose, can I remember what a is on this board? Two, one, two, so I'm projecting onto the line through there.
10:37
This is the projection, it's P times the vector u0, so what do I have for a transpose u0 looks like
10:44
eighteen, looks like twenty-seven, and a transpose a we figured was nine,
10:50
so it's three a, so that this is the -- this is the x hat,
10:57
the -- the multiple of a, in -- in our formulas, and of course that's six, three, six.
11:03
So that's u1.
11:08
Computed out directly. That's on the line through a and it's the closest point to u0,
11:17
and it's just Pu0. You just straightforward multiplication produces that.
11:23
OK. Now, what's u2?
11:28
Well, u2 is Pu1, I agree. Do I need to compute that again?
11:35
No, because once I'm already on the line through A, uk will be,
11:41
I could do the projection k times, but it's enough just to do it once.
11:47
It's the same, it's the same, six, three, six.
11:53
So this is a case where I could and --
11:59
and actually on the quiz if you see one of these, which could very well be there, and it could very well be not
12:09
a projection matrix, then we would use all the eigenvalues
12:16
and eigenvectors. Let's think for a moment, how do you do those? M - the point of this small part of a question was that when P
12:24
is a projection matrix, so that P squared equals P and P cubed equals P, then -- then we don't need to get into the mechanics
12:33
of all knowing all the other eigenvalues and eigenvectors. We just can go directly.
12:40
But if P was now some other matrix, can you just --
12:48
let's just remember from these very recent lectures how you would proceed. from these very recent lectures we know that uk we would --
12:57
we would expand u0 as a combination of eigenvectors.
13:02
Let me leave -- yeah, as a combination of eigenvectors, c1x1, some multiple of the second eigenvector,
13:12
some multiple of the third eigenvector, and then A to the ku0 would be c1, so this --
13:22
we have to find these numbers here, that's the work actually. The work is find the eigenvalues,
13:30
find the eigenvectors and find the c-s because they all come into the formula.
13:35
We have -- so -- so to do this, you can see what you have
13:50
to compute. You have to compute the eigenvalues, you have to compute the eigenvectors,
13:55
and then to match u0 you compute the c-s, and then you've got it.
14:01
So it's -- it's just that's a formula that shows what pieces
14:06
we need. And what would actually happen in the case of this projection
14:12
matrix? If this A is a projection matrix, then a couple of eigenvalues are zero.
14:19
That's why we just throw those away. The other eigenvalue was a one, so that we got the same thing
14:27
every time, c3x3. From the first time, second time,
14:33
third, all iterations pro- left us with this constant, left us right here at six, three, six.
14:39
But maybe I take -- I'm taking this chance to remind you of what to do for other matrices.
14:47
OK. So that's part way through.
14:52
OK. The next question in nineteen eighty-four is fitting a straight line to points.
15:01
And actually a straight line through the origin. A straight line through the origin.
15:06
So can I go to question two? So this is fitting a straight line to these points, can I --
15:15
I'll just give you the points at t=1 the y is four, at t=2,
15:26
y is five, at t=3, y is eight.
15:34
So we've got points one, two, three, four, five, and eight.
15:42
And I'm trying to fit a straight line through the origin to these three values.
15:48
OK, so my equation that I'm allowing myself
15:57
is just y equal Dt. So I have only one unknown.
16:03
One degree of freedom. One parameter D. So I'm expecting to end up my matrix so my -- my --
16:12
when I try to -- when I try to fit a straight line, that goes through the origin, that's because it goes
16:19
through the origin, I've lost the constant c here, so I have just this should be a quick calculation.
16:27
and I can write down the three equations that -- that --
16:32
that would -- I'd like to solve if the line went through the points, that's a good start.
16:38
Because that displays the matrix.
16:43
So can I continue that problem? We would like to solve--
16:48
so y is Dt, so I'd like to solve D times one times
16:54
D equals four, two times D equals five and three
17:00
times D equals eight. That would be perfection. If I could find such a D, then the line y
17:09
equal Dt would satisfy all three equations, would go through all three points, but it doesn't exist.
17:16
So -- so I have to solve this -- so the -- my matrix is now you can see my matrix, it just has one column.
17:23
Multiplying a scalar D. And you can see the right-hand side.
17:30
This is my Ax=b. I don't need three equals signs now because I've got vectors.
17:38
OK. There's Ax=b and you take it from there. You the -- the best x will be -- will come from --
17:47
so what's the -- the key equation? So this is the A, this is the Ax hat equal b equation.
17:54
Well, Ax=b. And what's the equation for x hat?
18:00
The best D, so to find the best D, the best x,
18:08
the equation is A transpose A, the best D,
18:14
is A transpose times the right-hand side.
18:20
This is all coming from projection on a line, our -- our matrix only has one column.
18:26
So A transpose A would be maybe fourteen, D hat, and A transpose b I'm getting four, ten,
18:35
and twenty-four. Is that right? Four, ten and twenty-four.
18:40
So thirty-eight. So that tells me the best D hat is D hat
18:47
is thirty-eight over fourteen. OK.
18:53
Fine. All right. so we found the best line.
18:59
And now here's a -- here's the next question. What vector did I just project onto what line?
19:07
See in this section on least squares here's the key point,
19:12
I'm -- I'm asking you to think of the least squares problem in two ways.
19:17
Two different pictures. Two different graphs. One graph is this.
19:22
This is a graph in the -- in the b -- in the tb plane, ty plane.
19:28
The -- the -- the line itself. The other picture I'm asking you to think of is like my projection picture.
19:35
What -- what projection -- what -- what vector I -- I projecting onto what line or what subspace when I -- when I
19:42
do this? So the -- my second picture is a projection picture that --
19:48
that sees the whole thing with vectors. Here's my vector of course that I'm projecting.
19:53
I'm projecting that vector b onto the column space of A.
20:06
Of if you like -- it's just a line onto that's the line
20:15
it's just a line, of course. That's what this calculation is doing.
20:21
This is computing the best D, which is -- this is the x hat.
20:30
So -- so seeing it as a projection means I don't see the projection in this figure, right?
20:36
In this figure I'm not projecting those points onto that line or anything of the sort.
20:41
The projection s-picture for -- for least squares is in the --
20:48
in the space where b lies, the whole vector b, and the columns of A.
20:54
And then the x is the best combination
21:02
that gives the projection. OK. So that's a chance to tell me that.
21:07
OK. I'll go -- OK now finally in orthogonality there's the Graham-Schmidt idea.
21:14
So that's problem two D here.
21:20
It asks me if I have two vectors, a1 equal one, two, three, and a2 equal one, one, one, find
21:32
two orthogonal vectors in that plane. So those two vectors give a plane, they give a plane.
21:43
Which is of course the -- the column space of the -- of the matrix.
21:50
And I'm looking for an orthogonal basis for that plane. So I'm looking for two orthogonal vectors.
21:58
And of course there are lots of -- I mean, I've got a plane there.
22:05
If I get one orthogonal pair, I can rotate it. There's not just one answer here.
22:10
But Graham-Schmidt says OK, start with the first vector,
22:16
and let that be -- and keep that one. And then take the second one orthogonal to this.
22:23
So -- so Graham-Schmidt says start with this one and then make a second vector B, can I call that second vector B,
22:31
this is going to be orthogonal to, so perpendicular to a1. If I can with my chalk create the key equation.
22:40
This vector B is going to be this one, one, one,
22:46
but that one, one -- one, one, one is not perpendicular to a1, so I have to subtract off its projection,
22:54
I have to subtract off the B, the -- the B trans- ye the B --
23:00
the -- the I should say the a1 transpose b over a1 transpose
23:07
a1, that multiple of a1, I've got to remove.
23:14
So I just have to compute what that is, and I get ano- I get a vector B that's orthogonal to a1.
23:21
It's the -- it's -- it's the original vector minus its projection.
23:29
Oh, so what is -- I mean this to be a2.
23:36
So I'm projecting a2 onto the line through a1. Yeah. That's the part that I don't want because that's
23:42
in the direction I already have, so I subtract off that projection and I get the part I want,
23:48
the orthogonal part. So that's the Graham-Schmidt thing and we can put numbers in.
23:54
OK. one, one, one take away a1 transpose a2 is six,
24:00
a1 transpose a1 is fourteen,multiplying a1.
24:06
And that gives us the new orthogonal vector B.
24:13
Because I only ask for orthogonal right now, I don't have to divide by the length which
24:19
will involve a square root. OK. Third question.
24:27
Third question. All right, let me -- I'll move this board up.
24:33
third question will probably be about eigenvalues. OK.
24:38
Three. This is a four-by-four matrix.
24:44
Its eigenvalues are lambda one, lambda two, lambda three, lambda four.
24:50
Question one. What's the condition on the lambdas so
24:55
that the matrix is invertible? OK. So under what conditions on the lambdas
25:02
will the matrix be invertible? So that's easy.
25:08
Invertible if what's the condition on the lambdas?
25:17
None of them are zero. A zero eigenvalue would mean something in the null space
25:23
would mean a solution to Ax=0x, but we're invertible, so none of them is zero, the product --
25:32
however you want to say, no -- no zero eigenvalues.
25:38
Good. OK, what's the determinant of A inverse? The determinant of A inverse?
25:45
So where is that going to come from?
25:52
Well, if we knew the eigenvalues of A inverse, we could multiply them together to find the determinant.
25:59
And we do know the eigenvalues of A inverse. What are they? They're just one over lambda one times
26:08
one over lambda two, that's the second eigenvalue, the third eigenvalue and the
26:13
fourth. So the product of the four eigenvalues of the inverse
26:18
will give us the determinant of the inverse. Fine. OK. And what's the trace of A plus I?
26:39
So what do we know about trace? It's the sum down the diagonal, but we
26:46
don't know what our matrix is. The trace is also the sum of the eigenvalues,
26:51
and we do know the eigenvalues of A plus I. So we just add them up.
26:57
So what -- what's the first eigenvalue of A plus I?
27:02
When the matrix A has eigenvalues lambda one, two, three and four, then the eigenvalues
27:08
if I add the identity, that moves all the eigenvalues by one, so I just add up lambda one plus one,
27:17
lambda two plus one, and so on, lambda three plus one, lambda
27:22
four plus one, so it's lambda one plus lambda two plus lambda three plus lambda four plus four.
27:32
Right. That movement by the identity moved all the eigenvalues
27:38
by one, so it moved the whole trace by four. So it was the trace of A plus four more.
27:45
OK. Let's see. We may be finished this quiz twenty minutes early.
27:51
No. There's another question. Oh, God, OK.
27:57
How did this class ever do it? Well, you'll see. you'll be able to do it.
28:02
OK. this has got to be a determinant question. All right.
28:09
More determinants and cofactors and big formula question. OK.
28:14
Let me do that. So it's about a matrix, a -- a whole family of matrices.
28:22
Here's the four-by-four one. The four-by-four one is, and -- and all the matrices in this
28:29
family are tridiagonal with --
28:35
with ones. Otherwise zeroes. So that's the pattern, and we've seen this matrix.
28:43
OK. So the -- it's tridiagonal with ones on the diagonal, ones above and ones below, and you see the general formula An,
28:52
so I'll use Dn for the determinant of An.
28:58
OK. All right. So I'm going to do a -- the first question is use cofactors to show that Dn is
29:14
something times D(n-1) plus something times D(n-2).
29:20
And find those somethings. OK.
29:26
So this -- the fact that it's tridiagonal with these constant diagonals means that there is such a recurrence formula.
29:37
And so the first question is find it. Well, what's the recurrence formula? OK, how does it go?
29:43
So I'll use cofactors along the first row. So I take that number times its cofactor.
29:51
So it's one times its cofactor and what is its cofactor?
29:56
D(n-1), right, exactly, the cofactor is this -- is this guy uses up row one and column one,
30:03
so the cofactor is down here, so it's one of those.
30:10
OK, that's the first cofactor term. Now the other cofactor term is this guy.
30:17
Which uses up row one and column two and what's surprising about that?
30:24
When you use row one and column two that brings in a minus.
30:30
There'll be a minus because the -- the cofactor is this determinant times minus one.
30:38
The the one-two cofactor is that determinant with its sign
30:44
changed. OK. So I have to look at that determinant and I have to remember in my head a sign is going to get changed.
30:50
OK. Now how do I do that determinant? How do I make that one clear?
30:58
I -- the -- the neat way to do is -- is here I see I -- I'll use cofactors down the first column.
31:05
Because the first column is all zeroes except for that one, so this one is now -- and what's its cofactor?
31:13
Within this three-by-three its cofactor will be two-by-two, and what is it?
31:19
It's this, right? So -- so that part is all gone, so I'm taking that times its
31:25
cofactor, then zero times whatever its cofactor is, so it's really just one times and what's this in the general
31:34
n-by-n case? It's Dn minus two.
31:39
But now so is this a plus or sign or a minus sign, it's -- it's just a one, because there's a one from there and a one from
31:48
there. And is it a plus or a minus? It's minus I guess because there was a minus the first time
31:56
and then the second time it's a plus, so it's overall it's a minus. So there's my a and b were one and minus one.
32:04
Those constants. Th- that's the -- that's the recurrence. OK.
32:10
And oh, then it asks you to then it asks you to solve this thing
32:19
first by writing it as a -- as a system.
32:25
So now I'd like to know the solution. I -- I better know how it starts, right?
32:30
It starts with D1, what was D1, that's just the one-by-one case, so D1 is one, and what is D2?
32:39
Just to get us started and then this would give us D3, D4, and forever.
32:45
D2 is this two-by-two that I'm seeing here and that determinant is obviously zero.
32:51
So those little ones will start the recurrence and then we take
32:57
off. And then the idea is to write this recurrence as -- as a Dn, D(n-1) is some matrix times the one before,
33:11
the D(n-1), D(n-2).
33:20
What's the matrix? You see, you remember this step of taking a single second order
33:26
equation and by introducing a vector unknown to make it into a --
33:32
to a first order system. OK. So Dn is one of Dn minus one minus one, I think that --
33:41
that goes in the first row, right? From the equation above? And the second one is this is the same as this,
33:48
so one and zero are fine.
33:53
So there's the matrix. OK. So now how do I proceed?
33:58
We can guess what this examiner's got in his little mind.
34:07
well, find the eigenvalues.
34:12
And actually it tells us that the sixth power
34:19
of these eigenvalues turns out to be one. Uh, well, can -- can we get the equation for the eigenvalues?
34:30
Let's do it and let's get a formula for them. OK. So what are the eigenvalues?
34:35
I look at the -- the matrix, this determinant one minus lambda and zero minus lambda, and these guys are still there,
34:44
I compute that determinant, I get lambda squared minus lambda and then plus one.
34:52
And I set that to zero. OK. So we're not Fibonacci here.
34:59
We're -- we're not seeing Fibonacci numbers. Because the sign -- we had a sign change there.
35:07
And it's not clear right away whether these -- whether this -- is it clear?
35:13
Is this matrix stable or unstable?
35:18
When we take -- when we go further and further out? Are these Ds increasing?
35:23
Are they going to zero? Are they bouncing around periodically? the answers have to be here.
35:30
I would like to know how big these lambdas are, right? And the point is probably these -- let's -- let's see,
35:37
what's lambda? From the quadratic formula lambda is one, I switch the sign of that, plus or minus
35:45
the square root of one minus 4ac, I getting a minus three
35:50
there? Over two.
35:58
What's up? They're complex. The -- the eigenvalues are one plus square root of three I
36:08
over two and one minus square root of three I over two.
36:15
What's the magnitude of lambda? That's the key point for stability.
36:22
These are two numbers in the complex plane. One plus some -- somewhere here, and its complex conjugate
36:30
there. I want to know how far from the origin are those numbers.
36:37
What's the magnitude of lambda? And do you see what it is?
36:43
Do you recognize this -- a number like that? Take the real part squared and the imaginary part squared
36:50
and add. What do you get? So the real part squared is a quarter.
36:57
The imaginary part squared is three-quarters. They add to one. That's a number with -- that's on the unit circle.
37:06
That's an e to the i theta. That's a cos(theta)+isin(theta). And what's theta?
37:14
This -- this is like a complex number that's worth knowing, it's not totally obvious but it's nice.
37:23
That's -- I should see that as cos(theta)+isin(theta), and the angle that would do that is sixty degrees,
37:30
pi over three. So that's a -- let me improve my picture.
37:36
So those -- that's e to the i pi over six -- pi over three. This is -- this number is e to the i pi over three and e
37:46
to the minus i pi over three. We'll be doing more complex numbers briefly
37:54
but a little more in the next two days.
37:59
next two lectures. Anyway, the -- so what's the deal with stability,
38:05
what do the Dn-s do? Well, look, if -- if I take the sixth power I'm around at one,
38:13
the problem actually told me this. The sixth power of those eigenvalues brings me around to
38:18
What does that tell you about the matrix, by the way? one. Suppose you know -- this was a great quiz question,
38:26
so I should never have just said it, but popped out. Suppose lambda one to the sixth and lambda two to the sixth are
38:33
-- are one, which they are. What does that tell me about a m- a matrix?
38:40
About my matrix A here. Well, what -- what matrix is connected with lambda one
38:47
to the sixth and lambda two to the sixth? It's got to be the matrix A to the sixth. So what is A to the sixth for that matrix?
38:55
It's got eigenvalues one and one. Because when I take the sixth power, actually, ye,
39:04
if I take the sixth power b- all the sixth power of that is one and the sixth power of that is one, the sixth power of this
39:12
is e to the two pi i, that's one, the sixth power of this is e to the minus two pi i, that's one.
39:19
So the sixth powers, the -- the sixth power of that matrix has eigenvalues one and one, so what is it?
39:27
It's the identity, right. So if I operate this -- if I run this thing six times,
39:33
I'm back where I was. The sixth power of that matrix is the identity.
39:39
Good. OK. So it'll loop around, it's -- it doesn't go to zero,
39:44
it doesn't blow up, it just periodically goes around with period six.
39:50
OK. let's just see if there's a -- all right.
39:58
I'll -- let's see. Could I also look at a -- at a final exam from nineteen ninety-two.
40:05
I think that's yeah, let me do that on this last board.
40:11
It starts -- a lot of the questions in this exam are
40:18
about a family of matrices. Let me give you the fourth, the fourth guy in the family is --
40:25
has a one, so it's zeroes on the diagonal, but these are going one, two, three and so on.
40:34
One, two, three, and so on. But, for the four-by-four case I'm stopping at four.
40:42
You see the pattern? It's a family of matrices which is growing,
40:49
and actually the numbers -- it's symmetric, right, it's equal to A4 transpose.
40:56
And we can ask all sorts of questions about its null space, its range, r- its column space find the projection
41:07
matrix onto the column space of A3, for example, is in here.
41:12
So -- so one -- so A3 is zero, one, zero, one, zero, two,
41:21
zero, two, zero.
41:32
OK, find the projection matrix onto the column space. By the way, is that matrix singular or invertible?
41:41
Singular. Why do we know it's singular? I see that column three is a multiple of column one.
41:50
Or we could take its determinant. So it's certainly singular.
41:55
The projection will be matrix will be three-by-three but it will project onto the column space,
42:03
it'll project onto this plane. The column space of A3, and I guess I would find it from
42:09
the formula AA -- AA transpose A inverse, I would have to --
42:15
I would -- I guess I would do all this.
42:20
There may be a better way, perhaps I could think there might be a slightly quicker way, but that would come out pretty fast.
42:27
OK. So that's be the projection matrix. Next question. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of that matrix.
42:35
OK. There's a three-by-three matrix, oh, yeah, so what are its eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
42:40
we haven't done any three-by-threes. Let's do one. I want to find, so how do I find eigenvalues?
42:48
I take the determinant of A3 minus lambda I. So this is you just have to -- so I'm subtracting lambda from
42:57
the diagonal, and I have a one, one, zero, zero, two,
43:02
two there, and I just have to find that determinant. OK, since it's three-by-three I'll just go for it.
43:11
This way gives me minus lambda cubed and a zero and zero.
43:16
Then in this direction which has the minus sign, that's a zero, four lambdas, I mean minus four lambdas,
43:25
and minus another lambda, so that's minus five lambdas, but that direction goes with a minus sign,
43:32
so I think it's plus five lambda. That looks like the determinant of A3 minus lambda I,
43:40
so I set it to zero. So what are the eigenvalues?
43:45
Well, lambda equals zero -- lambda factors out of this, times minus lambda squared plus four,
43:52
so the eigenvalues are five, thanks, thanks,
44:03
so the eigenvalues are zero, square root of five, and minus square root of five.
44:11
And I would never write down those three eigenvalues without checking the trace to tell the truth.
44:17
Because -- because we did a bunch of calculations here but then I can quickly add up the eigenvalues to get zero,
44:22
add up the trace to get zero, and feel that I'm -- well, I guess that wouldn't have caught my error if I'd made it
44:30
-- if -- if that had been a four I wouldn't have noticed,the determinant isn't anything greatly useful here, right,
44:37
because the determinant is just zero. And so I never would know whether that five
44:44
was right or wrong, but thanks for making it right. OK.
44:49
Ha. Question two c, whoever wrote this, probably me,
45:00
said this is not difficult. I don't know why I put that in.
45:06
just -- it asks for the projection matrix onto the column space of A4.
45:12
How could I have thought that wasn't difficult?
45:17
It looks extremely difficult. what's the projection matrix
45:25
onto the column space of A4?
45:32
I don't know whether that -- this is not difficult is just like helpful or -- or insulting.
45:37
Uh, what do you think? The -- what's the column space of A4 here?
45:43
Well, what's our first question is is the matrix singular
45:52
or invertible? If the answer is invertible, then what's the column space?
45:58
If -- if this matrix A4 is invertible, so that's my guess,
46:03
if this problem's easy it has to be because this matrix is probably invertible. Then its column space is R^4, good,
46:12
the column space is the whole space, and the answer to this easy question is the projection
46:18
matrix is the identity, it's the four-by-four identity matrix. If this matrix is invertible.
46:26
Shall we check invertibility? How would you find its determinant? Can we just like take the determinant of that matrix?
46:33
I could ask you how -- so there -- there are twenty-four terms, do we want to write all twenty-four terms down?
46:39
not in the remaining ten seconds. Better to use cofactors. So I go along row one, I see one --
46:47
the only nonzero is this guy, so I should take that one times the cofactor.
46:53
Now so I'm down to this determinant. OK. So now I'm -- look at this first column, I see one times this,
47:00
there's the cofactor of the one, so I'm using up row one -- row one and column one of this three-by-three matrix,
47:09
I'm down to this cofactor, and by the way, those were both plus signs, right? No, they weren't.
47:15
That was a minus sign. That was a -- that was a minus, and then that was a plus, and then this, so
47:22
what's the determinant? Nine. Nine. Determinant is nine.
47:27
Determinant of A4 is nine. OK. Where A3, so my guess is I'll put that on the final this
47:38
year, the -- probably the odd- numbered ones are singular and the even-numbered ones are invertible.
47:47
And I don't know what the determinants are but I'm betting that they have some nice formula.
47:55
OK. So, recitations this week will also be quiz review
48:02
and then the quiz is Wednesday at one o'clock.
48:08
Thanks.
