# Introduction
0:00
0:09
Okay. This is lecture six in linear algebra, and we're at the start of this new chapter, chapter three
0:19
in the text, which is really getting to the center of linear algebra.
0:24
And I had time to make a first start on it
0:31
at the end of lecture five. But now is lecture six is officially
0:38
the lecture on vector spaces and subspaces. And then especially -- there are two subspaces that
0:47
we're specially interested in. One is the column space of a matrix,
0:52
the other is the null space of the matrix. So, I got to tell you what those are.
0:59
Okay. So, first to remember from lecture five,
1:05
what is a vector space? It's a bunch of vectors that -- where I'm allowed --
1:14
where I can add -- I can add any two vectors in the space
1:19
and the answer stays in the space. Or I can multiply any vector in the space by any constant
1:27
and the result stays in the space. So that's -- in fact if I combine those two into one,
1:34
you can see that -- if I can add and I can multiply by numbers,
1:40
that really means that I can take linear combinations. So the quick way to say it is that all linear combinations,
1:50
C -- any multiple of V plus any multiple of W stay in the space.
1:56
So, can I give you examples that are vector spaces and also some examples that are not, to make that point clear?
2:04
So, suppose I'm in three dimensions.
# Subspaces
2:10
Then one way to get us one space is the whole three dimensional
2:16
space. So the whole space R^3, three dimensional space,
2:22
would be a vector space, because if I have a couple of vectors I can add them and I'm certainly okay and they follow all
2:30
the rules. So R^3 is easy. Now I'm interested also in subspaces.
2:39
So there's this key word, subspaces. That's a space -- that's some vectors inside the given space,
2:48
inside R three that still make up a vector space of their own.
2:53
It's a vector space inside a vector space. And the simplest example was a plane.
3:00
So, like, can I just sketch it -- there is a plane.
3:05
It's got to go through the origin, and of course it goes infinitely far.
3:10
That's of that's a subspace now. Do you see that if I have two vectors on the plane
3:18
and I add them, the result stays in the plane. If I take a vector in the plane and I multiply by minus two,
3:26
I'm still in the plane. So that plane is a subspace. So let me just make that point.
3:33
Plane through zero, through that zero zero zero is a subspace.
3:44
Okay. And also, another subspace would be a line.
3:51
A line through zero zero zero -- yeah, the line has to go through the origin. All subspaces have got to contain the origin,
3:59
contain zero -- the zero vector. So this line is a subspace.
4:07
Really, if I want to say it really correctly,
4:13
I should say a subspace of R^3. That of R^3 was, like, understood there.
4:23
Now -- so let me call this plane P. And let me call this line L.
4:30
And let me ask you about other sets of vectors.
4:40
Suppose I took -- yeah -- so here's a first question. Suppose I take two subspaces, like P and L.
4:50
And I just put them together, take their union, take all the vectors --
4:56
so now you've got P and L in mind, here. So I have two subspaces.
5:03
I have two subspaces and, for example, P --
5:09
a plane and L a line. Okay. Now I want to ask you about the union of those.
5:17
So P union L. This is all vectors in P or L or both.
5:29
Is that a subspace?
5:36
Is this a subspace? This is or is not a subspace?
5:48
Because we're -- I just want to be sure that I've got the central idea.
5:54
Suppose I take the vectors in the plane and also the vectors on that line,
6:03
put them together, so I've got a bunch of vectors, is it a subspace? Can you give me, like, so the camera
6:09
can hear it or maybe the tape. Can you say yes or no?
6:14
Do I have a subspace if I put -- if I take all the vectors
6:20
on the plane plus all -- and all the ones on the line and just join them together -- but I'm not taking this guy that's --
6:30
actually, I'm not taking most of them, because most vectors are not on the line or the plane,
6:35
they're off somewhere else. Do I have a subspace? STUDENTS: No.
6:40
STRANG: Right. Thank you. No. Because -- why not? Because I can't add.
6:47
Because if I that requirement isn't satisfied. If I take one vector like this guy and another vector
6:56
that happens to come from L and add, I'm off somewhere else. You see that I've gone outside the union if I just add
7:06
something from P and something from L, then normally what'll happen is I'm outside the union --
7:15
and I don't have a subspace. So the correct answer is -- is not.
7:21
Okay. Now let me ask you about -- the other thing we do is take the intersection.
7:28
So what does intersection mean? Intersection means all vectors that are in both P and L.
7:43
Is this a subspace. Yeah, so I guess I want to go back up to the same question.
7:49
This is or is not a subspace? And you can answer me -- answer the question first for this
7:56
particular example, this picture I drew. What is P intersect L for this case?
8:03
STUDENT: It's only zero. STRANG: It's only zero. At least, sort of this was the artist's idea as he drew it
8:11
that, that that line L was not in the plane and, went off
8:17
somewhere else -- and then the only point that was in common was the zero vector.
8:22
Is the zero vector by itself a subspace? STUDENT: Yes. STRANG: Yes, absolutely. And what about, if I don't have this plane and this line
8:34
but any subspace and any other subspace? So now -- can I ask that question for any two subspaces?
8:43
So maybe I'll write it up here. If I'm strong enough.
8:50
Okay. So this is the general question. I have subspaces, say S and T.
9:00
And I want to ask you about their intersection S intersect
9:08
T and I want -- it is a subspace.
9:17
Do you see why? Do you see why if I take the vectors that are in both one-
9:24
th- that are in both of the subspaces -- so that's like a smaller set of vectors, probably,
9:30
because it's -- we've added requirements. It has to be in S and in T.
9:36
How do I know that's a subspace? Can we just think through that abstract stuff and then I get to the examples.
9:43
Okay. So why? Suppose I take a couple of vectors
9:49
that are in the intersection. Why is the sum also in the intersection?
9:56
Okay, so let me give a name to these vectors, say V and W. They're in the intersection.
10:02
So that means they're both in S. Also means they're both in T.
10:08
So what can I say about V plus W? Is it in S?
10:14
Yes. Right? If I take two vectors, V and W that are both in S,
10:21
then the sum is in S, because S was a subspace. And if they're both in T and I add them,
10:27
then the result is also in T, because T was a subspace. So the result V plus W is in the intersection.
10:37
It's in both and requirement one is satisfied.
10:42
Requirement two's the same. If I take a vector that's in both, I multiply by seven.
10:49
Seven times that vector is in S, because the vector was in S. Seven times that vector's in T because the original one was in
10:57
T. So seven times that vector is in the intersection. In other words, when you take the intersection of two
# Column Space
11:05
subspaces, you get probably a smaller subspace, but it is a subspace. Okay.
11:11
So that's like sort of just emphasizing what
11:17
these two requirements mean. Again -- Let me circle those, because those are so important.
11:24
The sum and the scale of multiplication which combines
11:30
into linear combinations. That's what you have to do inside the subspace.
11:37
Okay. On to the column space. Okay. So my lecture last time started that and I want to continue it.
11:46
Okay. Column space of a matrix.
11:53
Of A. Okay. Can I take an example?
11:59
Say one two three four. One one one one.
12:06
Two three four five.
12:11
Okay. That's my matrix A.
12:19
So, it's got columns, three columns.
12:25
Those columns are vectors, so the column space of this A, of this A --
12:31
let's stay with this example for a while. The column space of this matrix is a subspace of R --
# Subspace
12:40
R what? So what space are we in if I'm looking at the columns of this matrix?
12:46
R^4 , right? These are vectors in R^4, they're four dimensional
12:52
vectors. So it's this column space of A is a subspace of R^4 here,
13:04
because A was four by -- A is a four by three matrix.
13:09
This tells me how many rows there are, how many components in a column, and so we're in R^4.
13:16
Okay, now what's in that subspace? So the column space of A, it's a subspace of R^4.
13:24
I call it the column space of A, like that. So that's my little symbol for some subspace of R^4.
13:34
What's in that subspace? Well, that column certainly is.
13:40
One two three four. This column is in. This column is in, and what else?
13:45
So it's got the columns of A in it, but that's not enough, certainly.
13:51
Right? I don't have a subspace if I just put in three vectors. So how do I fill that out to be a subspace?
13:59
I take their linear combinations.
14:06
So the column space of A is all linear combinations --
14:15
combinations of the columns. And that does give me a subspace.
14:22
It does give me a vector space, because if I have one linear combination and I multiply by eleven,
14:28
I've got another linear combination. If I have a linear combination, I add to another linear combination
14:33
I get a third combination. So that -- this is like the smallest space --
14:40
like, it's got to have those three columns in it, and it has to have their combinations
14:45
and that's where we stop. Okay. Now I'm going to be interested in that space.
14:54
So I, like -- get some idea of what's in that space. How big is that space? Is that space the whole four dimensional space?
15:02
Or is it a subspace inside? Can you -- let me just see if we can get a yes or no answer
15:13
sometimes without being ready for the complete proof.
15:19
What do you think? Is the subspace that I'm talking about here,
15:26
the combinations of those three guys, does that fill the full four dimensional space?
15:32
Maybe yes or no on that one. No. No. Somehow our feeling is, and it happens
15:39
to be right, that if we start with three vectors and take their combinations, we can't get the whole four
15:45
dimensional space. Now -- so somehow we get a smaller space.
15:52
But how much smaller? That's going to come up here. That's not so immediate.
16:00
Let me first make this critical connection with --
16:07
with, linear equations, because behind our abstract definition,
16:15
we have a purpose. And that is to understand Ax=b. So suppose I make the connection --
16:22
w- w- does A x=b always have a solution for every b?
16:33
Have a solution for every right-hand side?
16:47
I guess that's going to be a yes or no question.
16:53
And then I'm going to ask which right-hand sides are okay?
16:59
That's really the question I'm after, is which right-hand sides (b) do make up --
17:08
you can see from the way I'm speaking what the question -- As it is. The answer is no.
17:16
A x=b does not have a solution for every b.
17:21
Why do I say no? Because A x=b is -- like, this is four equations,
17:34
and only three unknowns. Right?
17:40
X is -- let me right out that whole --
17:46
what the whole thing looks like. Yeah. Let me write out A x=b.
17:54
A x is -- these columns are one two three four.
18:02
One one one one and two three four five. Then x, of course, has three components, x1, x2, x3.
18:12
And I'm trying to get the -- hit the right-hand side, b1,b2,b3 and b4.
18:19
18:25
So my first point is, I can't always do it.
18:30
In a way, that just says again what you told me five minutes ago --
18:36
that the combinations of these columns don't fill the whole four dimensional space.
18:42
There's going to be some vectors b, a lot of vectors b, that are not combinations of these three columns,
18:50
because the combinations of those columns are, like, going to be just a little plane or something inside --
18:56
inside R^4. Now, so and you see that I do have four equations and only
19:03
three unknowns. So, like anybody is going to say, no you dope,
19:09
you can't usually solve four equations with only three unknowns. But now I want to say sometimes you can.
19:17
For some right-hand sides, I can solve this. So that's the bunch of right-hand sides
19:25
that I'm interested in right now. Which right-hand sides allow me to solve this?
19:34
This is the question for today. It's going to have, like, a nice clear answer.
19:40
So my question is -- is which bs, which vectors b,
19:50
allow this system to be solved?
19:59
And I want to ask you -- so that's, like, gets two question marks to indicate
20:08
that's -- this is the important question. Okay, first, before we give a total answer,
20:15
give me just a partial answer. Tell me one right-hand side that I know
20:20
I can solve this thing for. So -- all zeroes. Okay. That's the, like, guaranteed.
20:28
If these were all zero, then I know I can solve it, let the x-s all be zero, no problem.
20:35
So that's always a -- okay. Okay. A x=0 I can always solve.
20:42
Now tell me another right-hand side, just a specific set of numbers for which I can solve these
20:52
three -- these four equations with only three unknowns, but if you give me a good right-hand side, I can do it.
21:00
So tell me one? STUDENT: 1 2 3 4. STRANG: 1 2 3 4? If I -- can I solve -- is that a good right-hand side?
21:09
Can you solve -- can you find a solution that --
21:15
X one plus X two plus two X three is one, two X one plus X two plus three X three is two and two more
21:22
equations -- so I'm asking you to solve in your head in --
21:30
within five seconds, four equations and three unknowns,
21:35
but you can do it, because the right-hand side is, like,
21:41
showing up here is -- it's one of the columns. So tell me what's the X that does solve it?
21:48
One zero zero. One zero zero solves it, because --
21:55
well, so you can multiply this out by rows, but oh God,
22:01
it's much nicer to say -- okay, this is one of this column, zero of this, zero of this, so it's one of that column,
22:09
which is exactly what we wanted. Okay. So there is a b that's okay.
22:17
Now tell me another B that's okay, another right-hand side that would be all right?
22:23
Well -- all ones?
22:29
Actually -- and then what's the solution in that case? 0 1 0, thanks.
22:36
And, in fact, it's much e- like, one way to do it is think of a solution first, right,
22:44
and then just see what b turns out to be.
22:50
What b turns out to be, right. Okay. So I think of a solution -- so I think of an x,
22:58
I think of any -- x1, x2, x3, I do this multiplication
23:03
and what have I got?
23:09
Now I'm ready to answer the big question. I can solve A x=b exactly when the right-hand side B is
23:20
a vector in the column space. Good.
23:25
I can solve A x=b when b is a combination of the columns,
23:33
when it's in the column space -- so let me write that answer down.
23:39
I can solve Ax=b exactly when B is in the column space.
23:57
Let me just say again why that is. Because it -- the column space by its definition contains all
24:07
the combinations. It contains all the Ax-s. The column space really consists of all vectors A times any X.
24:17
So those are the bs that I can deal with.
24:22
If b is a combination of the columns, then that combination tells me what X should be.
24:32
If b is not a combination of the columns, then there is no x. There's no way to solve A x equal b.
24:38
Okay. So the column space -- that's really why we're interested in this column
24:45
space, because it's the central guy. It says when we can solve, and that --
24:56
we got to understand this column space better.
25:02
Let's see. Do I want to think -- yeah, somehow -- oh, well, let's just --
25:10
as long as we've got it here, what do I get for this particular example? If I take combinations of this and this and this,
25:24
I'll tell you the question that's in my mind. It's not even proper to use this word yet,
25:30
but you'll know what it means. Are those three columns independent?
25:38
If I take the combinations of the three columns --
25:44
does each column contribute something new or now?
25:50
So that if I take the combinations of those three columns, do I, like, get some three dimensional subspace --
25:57
do I have three vectors that are, like, you know, independent, whatever that means?
26:07
Or do I -- is one of those columns, like, contributing nothing new -- So that actually only two of the columns
26:15
would have given the same column space? Yeah -- that's a good way to ask the question.
26:21
Finally I think of it. Can I throw away any columns -- and have the same column space?
26:27
STUDENT: Yes. STRANG: Yes. And which one do you suggest I throw away? STUDENT: Column three -- three.
26:32
STRANG: Well, three is the natural, like, guy to target. So if I -- and why?
26:39
Because -- what's so bad about three here?
26:44
Column three? It's the sum of these, right? So it's not -- if I'm taking -- if I have combinations of these
26:52
two and I put in this one, actually, I don't get anything more. So later on I will call these pivot columns.
27:02
And the third guy will not be a pivot column in this -- with those numbers.
27:08
Now actually -- honesty makes me ask you this question. Could I have thrown away column one?
27:16
Yes, I could. I could. So when I say pivot columns, my convention
27:22
is, okay, I'll keep the first ones as long as they're not dependent. So I keep this guy, he's fine, he's a line.
27:30
I keep the second guy. It's in a second direction. But the third one, which is in the same plane as the first two
27:39
gives me nothing new. It's dependent in the language that we will use
27:44
and I don't need it. Okay. So I would describe the column space of this matrix as a two
27:53
dimensional subspace of R^4.
# Null Space
27:58
A two dimensional subspace of R^4. Okay. So you're seeing how these vector spaces work and you --
28:05
you're seeing that we -- some idea of dependence or independence is in our future.
28:11
Okay. Now I want to speak about another vector space, the null space.
28:20
So again I'm getting a little ahead because it's in section three point two, but that's okay.
28:28
All right. Now I'm ready for the null space. Let me keep the same matrix.
28:33
And this is going to be a different --
28:39
totally different subspace. Totally different. Okay.
28:44
Now -- so let me make space for it. Now -- here comes a completely different subspace,
28:50
the null space of A.
29:00
What's in it? It contains not right-hand sides b.
29:10
It contains x-s. It contains all x-s that solve --
29:16
this word null is going to -- I mean, that's the key word here, meaning zero.
29:22
So this contains -- this is all solutions x,
29:30
and of course x is our vectors, x1, x2 and x3,
29:36
to the equation A x=0.
29:43
Well, four equations, because we've got -- so, do you see what I'm doing?
29:50
I'm now saying, okay, columns were great, the column space we understood.
29:56
Now I'm interested in x-s. I'm not -- the only b I'm interested in now is the b
30:02
of all zeroes. The right-hand side is now zeroes. And I'm interested in solutions.
30:08
x-s. So t- where is this null space for this example?
30:18
These x-s are -- have three components. So the null space is a subspace --
30:26
we still have to show it is a subspace -- of R^3.
30:31
So this is -- and we will show -- these vectors x, this is in R^3, where the column space was
30:46
in R^4 in our example. For an m by n matrix, this is m and this is n,
30:58
because the number of columns, n, tells me how many unknowns, how many x-s multiply those columns, so it tells me
31:05
the big space, in this case R three that I'm in. Now tell me -- why don't we figure out what the null space
31:14
is for this example, just by looking at it.
31:20
I mean, that's the beauty of small examples, that my official way to find null spaces and column spaces
31:30
and get all the facts straight would be elimination,
31:36
and we'll do that. But with a small example, we can see that -- see what's going on without going through the mechanics
31:43
of elimination. So this null space --
31:48
so I'm talking about -- again, the null space, and let me copy again the matrix.
31:56
One two three four, one one one one and two three four five.
32:04
What's in the null space? So I'm taking A times x, so let me right it again,
32:11
and I want you to solve those four equations.
32:19
In fact, I want you to find all solutions to those four equations. Well, actually, just first of all find one.
32:26
Why should I ask you for all of them? Tell me one -- well, tell me one solution that y- you don't even have to look at the matrix to know one solution
32:35
to this set of equations. It is zero vector.
32:41
Whatever that matrix is, its null space contains zero --
32:46
because A times the zero vector sure gives the zero right-hand side. So the null space certainly contains zero.
32:55
A- so it's got a chance to be a vector space now, and it will turn out it is. Okay.
33:00
Tell me another solution. So this particular null space -- and of course I'm going to call
33:07
it N(A) for null space -- this contains-- well we've already located the zero
33:17
vector, and now you're going to tell me another vector that's in the null space, another solution, another x,
33:24
another -- you see what I'm asking you for is a combination of those columns.
33:29
That's what I'm always looking at combinations of columns, but now I'm looking at the weights, the coefficients
33:40
in the combination. So tell me a good set of numbers to put in there.
33:46
One one -- STUDENTS: Minus one. STRANG: One one minus one. Thanks.
33:53
One one minus one. So there's a vector that's in it.
33:59
Okay. But have I got a subspace at this point? Certainly not, right?
34:04
I've got just a couple of vectors. No way they make a subspace. Tell me -- actually, why don't I jump the whole way now?
34:12
Tell me -- well, tell me one more solution, one more X that would work.
34:19
Student: 2 2 -2. STRANG: 2 2 -2? Oh, well, tell me all of them, that would have been easier.
34:27
Tell me the whole lot, now. What is the null space for this matrix?
34:34
It's all vectors of the form -- what could this be? It could be one one minus one, it could be it could be any
34:44
number C, any number -- the same number again and --
34:50
STUDENTS: Minus. STRANG: Minus C. In other words -- actually, any multiple of this guy.
34:59
Oh, that's the perfect description, because now the zero vector's automatically included
35:08
because C could be zero. The vector I had is included, because C could be one. But now any vector.
35:14
And that's actually it.
35:20
And do I have a subspace? And what does it look like?
35:26
It's in -- how would you describe this, the null space, this -- all these vectors of this form C C minus C, like,
35:35
seven seven minus seven. Minus eleven minus eleven plus eleven.
35:41
What have I got here? If -- describe that whole null space of -- what --
35:46
if I drew it, what do I draw? A line, right?
35:51
The null space is a line. It's the line through -- in R^3 and the vector one one negative
36:02
one maybe goes down here, I don't know where it goes, say, down here. There's the vector one one negative one that you gave me.
36:12
And where is the vector C C negative C? It's on this line. Of course, there's zero zero zero that we had.
36:19
And what we've got is that whole -- oops -- that whole line, going both ways, through the origin.
36:28
The null space is a line in R^3.
36:35
Okay. For that example, we could find all the combinations
36:43
of the columns that gave zero at sight. Now, can I just take one more time,
36:51
to go back to the definition of subspace, vector space,
36:57
and ask you -- how do I know that the null space is a vector space?
37:05
How I entitled to use this word space? I'll never use that word space without meaning that the two
37:13
requirements are satisfied. Can we just check that they are?
37:18
So I'm going to check that -- can I just continue here? Check that -- that the solutions to A x=0 always give
37:39
a subspace. And, of course, the key word is that= "Space."
37:47
So what do I have to check?
37:53
I have to show that if I have one solution, call it x, and another solution, call it x*,
38:01
that their sum is also a solution, right? That's a requirement.
38:07
To use that word space, I have to say -- I have to convince myself that if A x is zero and also --
38:18
and A x* is zero, or maybe I should have said if A v is zero
38:25
and A w is zero, then what about v plus w? Shall I -- let me use those letters.
38:32
If A v is zero and A w is zero, then what -- if that and that,
38:47
then what's my point here? That A times (v+w) must be zero.
38:55
That says that if v is in the null space and w's in the null space, then their sum v+w is in the null space.
39:03
And of course, now that I've written it down, it's totally absurd, ridiculously simple --
39:11
because matrix multiplication allows me to separate that out
39:17
into A v plus A w. I shouldn't say absurdly simple.
39:23
That was a dumb thing to say. Could -- we've used, here, a basic law of matrix
39:28
multiplication. Actually, we've used it without proving it, but that's okay.
39:34
We only live so long, we just skip that proof.
39:39
I think it's called the distributive law that I can split these -- split this into two pieces.
39:45
But now you see the point, that A v is zero and A w is zero
39:52
so I have zero plus zero and I do get zero. It checks. And, similarly, I have to show that if A v is zero,
40:02
then A times any multiple, say 12v is also zero.
40:10
And how do I know that? Because I'm allowed to s- bring that twelve outside. A number, a scaler can move outside, so I have twelve A vs,
40:20
twelve zeroes -- I have zero. Okay. Just to -- it's really critical to understand the --
# Vector Space
40:33
oh yeah. Here -- I was going to say, understand what's the point
40:38
of a vector space? Let me make that point by changing the right-hand side.
40:44
Oops. Okay. Let me change the right-hand side to one two three four. Oh, okay.
40:51
Why don't we do all of linear algebra in one lecture, then we -- okay. I would like to know the solutions to this equation.
41:00
For those four equations. So I have four equations.
41:06
I have only three unknowns, so if I don't have a pretty special right-hand side there won't be any solution at all.
41:12
But that is a very special right-hand side. And we know that there is a solution, one zero zero.
41:21
Were there any more solutions? And did they form a vector space?
41:27
Okay. So I'm asking two questions there. One is, do -- so my right-hand side now is not zero anymore.
41:35
I'm not looking at the null space because I changed from zeroes. So my first question is, do the solutions, if there are any
41:45
and there are, do they form a subspace? Let's answer that question first.
41:53
Yes or no. Do I get a subspace if I look at the solutions to --
41:59
let me go back to x1 x2 x3. I'm looking at all the x-s, at all those vectors in R^3 that
42:08
solve A x -b. The only thing I've changed is b isn't zero anymore.
42:17
Do the x-s, the solutions, form a vector space?
42:25
The solutions to this do not form a subspace.
42:32
The solutions don't, because -- how shall I see that?
42:38
The zero vector is not a solution, so I never even got started.
42:43
The zero vector doesn't solve this system. I can't -- solutions can't be a vector space.
42:51
Now what are they like? Well, we'll see this, but let's do it for this example.
42:58
So one zero zero was a solution. You saw that right away. Are there any other solutions?
43:05
Can you tell me a second solution to this system of equations?
43:10
STUDENTS: 0 -1 1 STRANG: 0 -1 1. Boy, that's -- 0 -1 1.
43:19
Yes. Because that says I take minus this column plus this one and sure enough.
43:24
That's right. So there are -- there's a bunch of solutions here.
43:30
But they're not a subspace.
43:37
I'll tell you what it's like. It's like a plane that doesn't go through the origin, or a line that doesn't go through the origin.
43:43
Maybe in this case it's a line that doesn't go through the origin, if I graft the solutions to A x equal B.
43:50
So you -- I think you've got the idea. Subspaces have to go through the origin.
43:56
If I'm looking at x-s, then they'd better solve Ax=0. In a way I've got --
44:04
my two subspaces that I -- talking about today are kind
44:10
of the two ways I can tell you what a -- about subspace.
44:17
If I want to tell you about the column space, I tell you a few columns and I say take their combinations.
44:24
Like I build up this subspace. I put in a few vectors, their combinations make a subspace.
44:31
Now, when I went to -- let me come back to the one that is a subspace here.
44:40
Here, when I talked about the null space, I didn't tell you what's in it.
44:46
We had to figure out what was in it. What I told you was the equations that I'm --
44:53
that has to be satisfied. You see those -- like, those are the two natural ways to tell you
44:59
what's in a subspace. I can either give you a few vectors and say fill it out,
45:06
take combinations -- or I can give you a system of equations, the requirements
45:12
that the x-s have to satisfy. And both of those ways produce subspaces
45:20
and they're the important ways to construct subspaces. Okay, so today's lecture actually got,
45:29
the essentials of three point two, the idea of the null space.
45:35
Now we have to tackle, Wednesday, the job of how do we actually get hold
45:40
of that subspace in an example that's bigger and we can't see it just by eye.
45:45
Okay. See you Wednesday.
45:57
Thanks.
