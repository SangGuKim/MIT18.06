I've been multiplying matrices already,
0:13
but certainly time for me to discuss the rules for matrix multiplication.
0:19
And the interesting part is the many ways you can do it,
0:24
and they all give the same answer. And they're all important. So matrix multiplication, and then, come inverses.
0:33
So we mentioned the inverse of a matrix. That's a big deal.
0:39
Lots to do about inverses and how to find them. Okay, so I'll begin with how to multiply two matrices.
0:48
First way, okay, so suppose I have a matrix A multiplying
0:57
a matrix B and -- giving me a result --
1:03
well, I could call it C. A times B. Okay.
1:10
So, let me just review the rule for this entry.
1:18
That's the entry in row i and column j. So that's the i j entry.
1:24
Right there is C i j. We always write the row number and then the column number.
1:30
So I might -- I might -- maybe I take it C 3 4, just to make it specific.
1:37
So instead of i j, let me use numbers. C 3 4. So where does that come from, the three four entry?
1:45
It comes from row three, here, row three and column four,
1:53
as you know. Column four. And can I just write down, or can we write down the formula for it?
2:05
If we look at the whole row and the whole column, the quick way for me to say it is row three of A --
2:15
I could use a dot for dot product. I won't often use that, actually. Dot column four of B.
2:25
But this gives us a chance to just, like, use a little matrix notation.
2:31
What are the entries? What's this first entry in row three?
2:38
That number that's sitting right there is... A, so it's got two indices and what are they?
2:46
3 1. So there's an a 3 1 there. Now what's the first guy at the top of column four?
2:56
So what's sitting up there? B 1 4, right.
3:01
So that this dot product starts with A 3 1 times B 1 4.
3:09
And then what's the next -- so this is like I'm accumulating this sum, then comes the next guy, A 3 2, second column,
3:20
times B 2 4, second row. So it's b A 3 2, B 2 4 and so on.
3:31
Just practice with indices. Oh, let me even practice with a summation formula.
3:39
So this is -- most of the course, I use whole vectors.
3:44
I very seldom, get down to the details of these particular entries, but here we'd better do it.
3:53
So it's some kind of a sum, right? Of things in row three, column K shall I say?
4:03
Times things in row K, column four.
4:09
Do you see that that's what we're seeing here? This is K is one, here K is two, on along --
4:17
so the sum goes all the way along the row and down the column, say, one to N.
4:25
So that's what the C three four entry looks like. A sum of a three K b K four.
4:34
Just takes a little practice to do that. Okay. And -- well, maybe I should say --
4:42
when are we allowed to multiply these matrices? What are the shapes of these things?
4:48
The shapes are -- if we allow them to be not necessarily square matrices.
4:54
If they're square, they've got to be the same size. If they're rectangular, they're not the same size.
5:01
If they're rectangular, this might be -- well, I always think of A as m by n.
5:08
m rows, n columns. So that sum goes to n.
5:13
Now what's the point -- how many rows does B have to have?
5:19
n. The number of rows in B, the number of guys that we meet coming down has to match the number of ones
5:25
across. So B will have to be n by something.
5:30
Whatever. P. So the number of columns here has to match the number of rows
5:39
there, and then what's the result? What's the shape of the result? What's the shape of C, the output?
5:45
Well, it's got these same m rows -- it's got m rows.
5:51
And how many columns? P. m by P. Okay.
5:58
So there are m times P little numbers in there, entries, and each one, looks like that.
6:05
Okay. So that's the standard rule. That's the way people think of multiplying matrices.
6:11
I do it too.
6:17
But I want to talk about other ways to look at that same calculation,
6:24
looking at whole columns and whole rows.
6:30
Okay. So can I do A B C again? A B equaling C again?
6:35
But now, tell me about...
6:42
I'll put it up here. So here goes A, again, times B producing C.
6:58
And again, this is m by n. This is n by P and this is m by P. Okay.
7:06
Now I want to look at whole columns. I want to look at the columns of --
7:12
here's the second way to multiply matrices. Because I'm going to build on what I know already.
7:19
How do I multiply a matrix by a column? I know how to multiply this matrix by that column.
7:27
Shall I call that column one?
7:33
That tells me column one of the answer.
7:38
The matrix times the first column is that first column. Because none of this stuff entered
7:45
that part of the answer. The matrix times the second column is the second column of the answer.
7:51
Do you see what I'm saying? That I could think of multiplying a matrix
7:57
by a vector, which I already knew how to do, and I can think of just P columns sitting side by side,
8:08
just like resting next to each other. And I multiply A times each one of those.
8:15
And I get the P columns of the answer. Do you see this as -- this is quite nice,
8:21
to be able to think, okay, matrix multiplication works
8:27
so that I can just think of having several columns, multiplying by A and getting the columns of the answer.
8:35
So, like, here's column one shall I call that column one?
8:43
And what's going in there is A times column one.
8:53
Okay. So that's the picture a column at a time. So what does that tell me?
8:58
What does that tell me about these columns? These columns of C are combinations,
9:09
because we've seen that before, of columns of A.
9:23
Every one of these comes from A times this, and A times a vector is a combination
9:30
of the columns of A. And it makes sense, because the columns of A have length m
9:40
and the columns of C have length m. And every column of C is some combination
9:48
of the columns of A. And it's these numbers in here that tell me what combination it is.
9:53
Do you see that? That in that answer, C, I'm seeing stuff that's
10:01
combinations of these columns. Now, suppose I look at it -- that's two ways now.
10:09
The third way is look at it by rows. So now let me change to rows.
10:17
Okay. So now I can think of a row of A --
10:23
a row of A multiplying all these rows here and producing a row
10:29
of the product. So this row takes a combination of these rows
10:36
and that's the answer. So these rows of C are combinations of what?
10:50
Tell me how to finish that. The rows of C, when I have a matrix B, it's got its rows
11:01
and I multiply by A, and what does that do? It mixes the rows up.
11:06
It creates combinations of the rows of B, thanks.
11:13
Rows of B. That's what I wanted to see, that this answer --
11:24
I can see where the pieces are coming from. The rows in the answer are coming as combinations of these
11:31
rows. The columns in the answer are coming as combinations of those
11:37
columns. And so that's three ways. Now you can say, okay, what's the fourth way?
11:44
The fourth way -- so that's -- now we've got, like, the regular way,
11:52
the column way, the row way and --
11:58
what's left? The one that I can --
12:06
well, one way is columns times rows.
12:12
What happens if I multiply -- So this was row times column, it gave a number.
12:21
Okay. Now I want to ask you about column times row. If I multiply a column of A times a row of B,
12:37
what shape I ending up with? So if I take a column times a row,
12:43
that's definitely different from taking a row times a column. So a column of A was -- what's the shape of a column of A?
12:52
m by one. A column of A is a column.
12:59
It's got m entries and one column. And what's a row of B?
13:04
It's got one row and P columns.
13:10
So what's the shape -- what do I get if I multiply a column by a row?
13:16
I get a big matrix. I get a full-sized matrix. If I multiply a column by a row --
13:25
should we just do one? Let me take the column two three four times the row one six.
13:34
That product there --
13:40
I mean, when I'm just following the rules of matrix multiplication, those rules are just looking like --
13:46
kind of petite, kind of small, because the rows here
13:51
are so short and the columns there are so short, but they're the same length, one entry.
13:56
So what's the answer? What's the answer if I do two three four times one six, just
14:03
for practice? Well, what's the first row of the answer?
14:09
Two twelve. And the second row of the answer is three eighteen.
14:16
And the third row of the answer is four twenty four.
14:24
That's a very special matrix, there.
14:29
Very special matrix. What can you tell me about its columns, the columns of that matrix?
14:37
They're multiples of this guy, right? They're multiples of that one.
14:42
Which follows our rule. We said that the columns of the answer were combinations, but there's only -- to take a combination of one guy,
14:50
it's just a multiple. The rows of the answer, what can you tell me about those three rows?
14:55
They're all multiples of this row.
15:01
They're all multiples of one six, as we expected. But I'm getting a full-sized matrix.
15:06
And now, just to complete this thought, if I have --
15:15
let me write down the fourth way.
15:21
A B is a sum of columns of A times rows of B.
15:35
So that, for example, if my matrix was two three four
15:40
and then had another column, say, seven eight nine,
15:47
and my matrix here has -- say, started with one six and then
15:53
had another column like zero zero, then --
16:00
here's the fourth way, okay? I've got two columns there, I've got two rows there.
16:07
So the beautiful rule is -- see, the whole thing by columns and rows
16:13
is that I can take the first column times the first row
16:19
and add the second column times the second row.
16:25
16:32
So that's the fourth way -- that I can take columns times rows,
16:38
first column times first row, second column times second row and add. Actually, what will I get?
16:44
What will the answer be for that matrix multiplication?
16:49
Well, this one it's just going to give us zero, so in fact I'm back to this -- that's the answer,
16:56
for that matrix multiplication. I'm happy to put up here these facts about matrix
17:05
multiplication, because it gives me a chance to write down special matrices like this.
17:12
This is a special matrix. All those rows lie on the same line.
17:18
All those rows lie on the line through one six. If I draw a picture of all these row vectors,
17:25
they're all the same direction. If I draw a picture of these two column vectors,
17:30
they're in the same direction. Later, I would use this language.
17:37
Not too much later, either. I would say the row space, which is like all the combinations of the rows,
17:44
is just a line for this matrix. The row space is the line through the vector one six.
17:51
All the rows lie on that line. And the column space is also a line.
17:57
All the columns lie on the line through the vector two three four.
18:02
So this is like a really minimal matrix. And it's because of these ones.
18:10
Okay. So that's a third way.
18:18
Now I want to say one more thing about matrix multiplication while we're on the subject.
18:26
And it's this. You could also multiply -- You could also cut the matrix into blocks
18:34
and do the multiplication by blocks. Yet that's actually so, useful that I want to mention it.
18:46
Block multiplication. So I could take my matrix A and I could chop it up, like,
18:54
maybe just for simplicity, let me chop it into two -- into four square blocks.
18:59
Suppose it's square. Let's just take a nice case. And B, suppose it's square also, same size.
19:07
So these sizes don't have to be the same.
19:13
What they have to do is match properly. Here they certainly will match.
19:18
So here's the rule for block multiplication, that if this has blocks like, A --
19:28
so maybe A1, A2, A3, A4 are the blocks here,
19:34
and these blocks are B1, B2,3 and B4? Then the answer I can find block.
19:44
And if you tell me what's in that block, then I'm going to be quiet about matrix multiplication for the rest of the day.
19:51
What goes into that block? You see, these might be -- this matrix might be --
19:57
these matrices might be, like, twenty by twenty with blocks that are ten by ten, to take the easy case where all the blocks
20:06
are the same shape. And the point is that I could multiply those by blocks.
20:13
And what goes in here? What's that block in the answer?
20:20
A1 B1, that's a matrix times a matrix, it's the right size, ten by ten.
20:28
Any more? Plus, what else goes in there?
20:36
A2 B3, right? It's just like block rows times block columns.
20:45
Nobody, I think, not even Gauss could see instantly that it works.
20:51
But somehow, if we check it through, all five ways we're doing the same multiplications.
20:58
So this familiar multiplication is what we're really doing when we do it
21:04
by columns, by rows by columns times rows and by blocks.
21:10
Okay. I just have to, like, get the rules straight for matrix multiplication.
21:16
Okay.
21:22
All right, I'm ready for the second topic, which is inverses. Okay.
21:28
Ready for inverses.
21:34
And let me do it for square matrices first.
21:44
Okay. So I've got a square matrix A.
21:52
And it may or may not have an inverse, right? Not all matrices have inverses. In fact, that's the most important question you can ask
22:01
about the matrix, is if it's -- if you know it's square, is it invertible or not?
22:08
If it is invertible, then there is some other matrix, shall I call it A inverse?
22:15
And what's the -- if A inverse exists --
22:21
there's a big "if" here. If this matrix exists, and it'll be really central to figure out
22:34
when does it exist? And then if it does exist, how would you find it?
22:40
But what's the equation here that I haven't --
22:45
that I have to finish now? This matrix, if it exists multiplies A and produces,
22:53
I think, the identity.
23:10
But a real -- an inverse for a square matrix could be on the right as well
23:17
-- this is true, too, that it's --
23:25
if I have a -- yeah in fact, this is not -- this is probably the --
23:31
this is something that's not easy to prove, but it works.
23:38
That a left -- square matrices, a left inverse is also a right
23:43
inverse. If I can find a matrix on the left that gets the identity,
23:49
then also that matrix on the right will produce that identity. For rectangular matrices, we'll see a left inverse
23:57
that isn't a right inverse. In fact, the shapes wouldn't allow it. But for square matrices, the shapes
24:03
allow it and it happens, if A has an inverse.
24:09
Okay, so give me some cases -- let's see. I hate to be negative here, but let's talk
24:17
about the case with no inverse. So -- these matrices are called invertible or non-singular --
24:31
24:36
those are the good ones. And we want to be able to identify how -- if we're given a matrix, has it got an inverse?
24:44
Can I talk about the singular case?
24:52
No inverse.
24:57
All right. Best to start with an example.
25:02
Tell me an example -- let's get an example up here. Let's make it two by two --
25:09
of a matrix that has not got an inverse. And let's see why.
25:16
Let me write one up. No inverse. Let's see why.
25:22
Let me write up -- one three two six.
25:30
Why does that matrix have no inverse?
25:37
You could answer that various ways.
25:43
Give me one reason.
25:48
Well, you could -- if you know about determinants, which you're not supposed to, you could take its determinant
25:57
and you would get -- Zero. Okay.
26:03
Now -- all right. Let me ask you other reasons.
26:10
I mean, as for other reasons that that matrix isn't invertible.
26:15
Here, I could use what I'm saying here.
26:24
Suppose A times other matrix gave the identity.
26:32
Why is that not possible? Because -- oh, yeah --
26:39
I'm thinking about columns here. If I multiply this matrix A by some other matrix, then the --
26:46
the result -- what can you tell me about the columns? They're all multiples of those columns, right?
26:55
If I multiply A by another matrix that -- the product has columns that come from those columns.
27:04
So can I get the identity matrix? No way. The columns of the identity matrix, like one zero --
27:11
it's not a combination of those columns, because those two columns lie on the -- both lie on the same line.
27:19
Every combination is just going to be on that line and I can't get one zero.
27:24
So, do you see that sort of column picture of the matrix
27:33
not being invertible. In fact, here's another reason. This is even a more important reason.
27:40
Well, how can I say more important? All those are important. This is another way to see it.
27:47
A matrix has no inverse -- yeah -- here -- now this is important.
27:55
A matrix has no -- a square matrix won't have an inverse if there's no inverse because I can solve --
28:07
I can find an X of -- a vector X with A times --
28:20
this A times X giving zero.
28:27
This is the reason I like best. That matrix won't have an inverse.
28:33
Can you -- well, let me change I to U.
28:40
So tell me a vector X that, solves A X equals zero.
28:46
I mean, this is, like, the key equation. In mathematics, all the key equations have zero on the right-hand side.
28:53
So what's the X? Tell me an X here -- so now I'm going to put -- slip in the X that you tell me
29:01
and I'm going to get zero. What X would do that job?
29:09
Three and negative one? Is that the one you picked, or -- yeah. Or another -- well, if you picked zero with zero,
29:18
I'm not so excited, right? Because that would always work. So it's really the fact that this vector
29:26
isn't zero that's important. It's a non-zero vector and three negative one would do it.
29:33
That just says three of this column minus one of that column is the zero column.
29:38
Okay. So now I know that A couldn't be invertible.
29:46
But what's the reasoning? If A X is zero, suppose I multiplied by A inverse.
29:54
Yeah, well here's the reason. Here -- this is why this spells disaster for an inverse.
30:02
The matrix can't have an inverse if some combination of the columns gives z- it gives nothing.
30:09
Because, I could take A X equals zero, I could multiply by A inverse and what would I discover?
30:21
Suppose I take that equation and I multiply by -- if A inverse existed, which of course I'm going to come
30:26
to the conclusion it can't because if it existed, if there was an A inverse to this dopey matrix,
30:33
I would multiply that equation by that inverse and I would discover X is zero.
30:42
If I multiply A by A inverse on the left, I get X. If I multiply by A inverse on the right, I get zero.
30:48
So I would discover X was zero. But it -- X is not zero. X -- this guy wasn't zero.
30:54
There it is. It's three minus one. So, conclusion -- only, it takes us some time to really work
31:06
with that conclusion -- our conclusion will be that non-invertible matrices,
31:14
singular matrices, some combinations of their columns
31:19
gives the zero column. They they take some vector X into zero.
31:26
And there's no way A inverse can recover, right? That's what this equation says.
31:32
This equation says I take this vector X and multiplying by A gives zero.
31:39
But then when I multiply by A inverse, I can never escape from zero.
31:44
So there couldn't be an A inverse. Where here -- okay, now fix --
31:51
all right. Now let me take -- all right, back to the positive side.
31:57
Let's take a matrix that does have an inverse. And why not invert it?
32:03
Okay. Can I -- so let me take on this third board a matrix -- shall I fix that up a little?
32:09
Tell me a matrix that has got an inverse.
32:15
Well, let me say one three two -- what shall I put there?
32:22
Well, don't put six, I guess is -- right?
32:28
Do I any favorites here?
32:35
One? Or eight?
32:41
I don't care. What, seven? Seven. Okay. Seven is a lucky number. All right, seven, okay.
32:48
Okay. So -- now what's our idea? We believe that this matrix is invertible. Those who like determinants have quickly taken its determinant
32:57
and found it wasn't zero. Those who like columns, and probably that --
33:04
that department is not totally popular yet -- but those who like columns will look at those two columns
33:11
and say, hey, they point in different directions. So I can get anything.
33:18
Now, let me see, what do I mean? How I going to computer A inverse? So A inverse --
33:24
here's A inverse, now, and I have to find it. And what do I get when I do this multiplication?
33:33
The identity.
33:40
You know, forgive me for taking two by two-s, but -- lt's good to keep the computations manageable and let
33:49
the ideas come out. Okay, now what's the idea I want?
33:55
I'm looking for this matrix A inverse, how I going to find it? Right now, I've got four numbers to find.
34:04
I'm going to look at the first column.
34:12
Let me take this first column, A B. What's up there?
34:18
What -- tell me this. What equation does the first column satisfy?
34:25
The first column satisfies A times that column is one zero.
34:31
The first column of the answer. And the second column, C D, satisfies A times
34:38
that second column is zero one. You see that finding the inverse is like solving two systems.
34:48
One system, when the right-hand side is one zero -- I'm just going to split it into two pieces.
34:54
I don't even need to rewrite it. I can take A times -- so let me put it here.
35:04
A times column j of A inverse is column j of the identity.
35:18
I've got n equations. I've got, well, two in this case.
35:26
And they have the same matrix, A, but they have different right-hand sides. The right-hand sides are just the columns
35:32
of the identity, this guy and this guy. And these are the two solutions. Do you see what I'm going --
35:39
I'm looking at that equation by columns.
35:45
I'm looking at A times this column, giving that guy, and A times that column giving that guy. So -- Essentially -- so this is like the Gauss --
35:55
we're back to Gauss. We're back to solving systems of equations, but we're solving --
36:00
we've got two right-hand sides instead of one. That's where Jordan comes in.
36:07
So at the very beginning of the lecture, I mentioned Gauss-Jordan, let me write it up again.
36:13
Okay. Here's the Gauss-Jordan idea.
36:21
Gauss-Jordan solve two equations at once.
36:35
Okay. Let me show you how the mechanics go.
36:43
How do I solve a single equation?
36:48
So the two equations are one three two seven,
36:55
multiplying A B gives one zero.
37:01
And the other equation is the same one three two seven multiplying C D gives zero one.
37:12
Okay. That'll tell me the two columns of the inverse.
37:17
I'll have inverse. In other words, if I can solve with this matrix A,
37:22
if I can solve with that right-hand side and that right-hand side, I'm invertible.
37:28
I've got it. Okay. And Jordan sort of said to Gauss, solve them together,
37:36
look at the matrix -- if we just solve this one, I would look at one three two seven,
37:43
and how do I deal with the right-hand side? I stick it on as an extra column, right?
37:48
37:56
That's this augmented matrix. That's the matrix when I'm watching the right-hand side
38:01
at the same time, doing the same thing to the right side that I do to the left? So I just carry it along as an extra column.
38:09
Now I'm going to carry along two extra columns.
38:17
And I'm going to do whatever Gauss wants, right? I'm going to do elimination.
38:24
I'm going to get this to be simple and this thing will turn into the inverse.
38:30
This is what's coming. I'm going to do elimination steps to make this
38:35
into the identity, and lo and behold, the inverse will show up here.
38:41
K--- let's do it. Okay. So what are the elimination steps?
38:46
So you see -- here's my matrix A and here's the identity, like, stuck on, augmented on.
38:52
STUDENT: I'm sorry... STRANG: Yeah? STUDENT: -- is the two and the three supposed to be switched?
38:58
STRANG: Did I -- oh, no, they weren't supposed to be switched. Sorry. Thanks.
39:04
Okay. Thank you very much. And there -- I've got them right.
39:09
Okay, thanks. Okay.
39:15
So let's do elimination. All right, it's going to be simple, right? So I take two of this row away from this row.
39:23
So this row stays the same and two of those come away from this. That leaves me with a zero and a one and two of these away from
39:32
this is that what you're getting -- after one elimination step --
39:39
Let me sort of separate the -- the left half from the right half.
39:45
So two of that first row got subtracted from the second row. Now this is an upper triangular form.
39:53
Gauss would quit, but Jordan says keeps going. Use elimination upwards.
39:59
Subtract a multiple of equation two from equation one to get rid of the three.
40:05
So let's go the whole way. So now I'm going to -- this guy is fine, but I'm going to --
40:14
what do I do now? What's my final step that produces the inverse?
40:19
I multiply this by the right number to get up to ther to remove that three.
40:26
So I guess, I -- since this is a one, there's the pivot sitting there. I multiply it by three and subtract from that,
40:33
so what do I get? I'll have one zero -- oh, yeah that was my whole point. I'll multiply this by three and subtract from that,
40:41
which will give me seven. And I multiply this by three and subtract from that,
40:49
which gives me a minus three.
41:00
And what's my hope, belief?
41:06
Here I started with A and the identity, and I ended up with the identity and who?
41:16
That better be A inverse.
41:24
That's the Gauss Jordan idea. Start with this long matrix, double-length A I, eliminate,
41:33
eliminate until this part is down to I, then this one will -- must be for some reason,
41:40
and we've got to find the reason -- must be A inverse. Shall I just check that it works?
41:46
Let me just check that -- can I multiply this matrix this part
41:55
times A, I'll carry A over here and just do that
42:00
multiplication. You'll see I'll do it the old fashioned way. Seven minus six is a one.
42:06
Twenty one minus twenty one is a zero, minus two plus two is a zero, minus six plus seven is a one.
42:13
Check. So that is the inverse.
42:18
That's the Gauss-Jordan idea. So, you'll -- one of the homework problems or more than
42:24
one for Wednesday will ask you to go through those steps.
42:30
I think you just got to go through Gauss-Jordan a couple of times, but I --
42:38
yeah -- just to see the mechanics.
42:43
But the, important thing is, why -- is, like, what happened?
42:50
Why did we -- why did we get A inverse there? Let me ask you that.
42:57
We got -- so we take --
43:03
We do row reduction, we do elimination on this long matrix A I until the first half
43:12
Then a second half is A inverse. is up. Well, how do I see that?
43:20
Let me put up here how I see that. So here's my Gauss-Jordan thing, and I'm doing stuff to it.
43:30
So I'm -- well, whole lot of E's.
43:37
Remember those are those elimination matrices. Those are the -- those are the things that we figured out last
43:42
time. Yes, that's what an elimination step is it's in matrix form,
43:49
I'm multiplying by some Es. And the result -- well, so I'm multiplying by a whole bunch
43:55
of Es. So, I get a -- can I call the overall matrix E?
44:02
That's the elimination matrix, the product of all those little pieces. What do I mean by little pieces?
44:09
Well, there was an elimination matrix that subtracted two of that away from that.
44:14
Then there was an elimination matrix that subtracted three of that away from that. I guess in this case, that was all.
44:21
So there were just two Es in this case, one that did this step and one that did this step
44:26
and together they gave me an E that does both steps.
44:31
And the net result was to get an I here.
44:38
And you can tell me what that has to be.
44:45
This is, like, the picture of what happened. If E multiplied A, whatever that E is --
44:53
we never figured it out in this way.
44:59
But whatever that E times that E is, E times A is --
45:06
What's E times A?
45:12
It's I. That E, whatever the heck it was, multiplied A and produced
45:20
So E must be -- E A equaling I tells us what E is, I. namely it is --
45:30
STUDENT: It's the inverse of A. STRANG: It's the inverse of A. Great.
45:35
And therefore, when the second half, when E multiplies I, it's E --
45:41
Put this A inverse. You see the picture looking that way?
45:48
E times A is the identity. It tells us what E has to be.
45:53
It has to be the inverse, and therefore, on the right-hand side, where E -- where we just smartly tucked on the identity,
46:00
it's turning in, step by step -- It's turning into A inverse.
46:05
There is the statement of Gauss-Jordan elimination.
46:12
That's how you find the inverse. Where we can look at it as elimination,
46:19
as solving n equations at the same time -- --
46:24
and tacking on n columns, solving those equations and up goes the n columns of A inverse Okay, thanks.
46:32
See you on Wednesday.
