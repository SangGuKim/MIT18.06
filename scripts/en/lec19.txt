0:08
OK, this is the second lecture on determinants.
0:13
There are only three. With determinants it's a fascinating, small topic
0:19
inside linear algebra. Used to be determinants were the big thing, and linear algebra was the little thing, but they --
0:27
those changed, that situation changed. Now determinants is one specific part, very neat little part.
0:36
And my goal today is to find a formula for the determinant.
0:41
It'll be a messy formula. So that's why you didn't see it right away.
0:49
But if I'm given this n by n matrix then I use those entries to create
0:55
this number, the determinant. So there's a formula for it. In fact, there's another formula, a second formula using
1:03
something called cofactors. So you'll -- you have to know what cofactors are. And then I'll apply those formulas
1:10
for some, some matrices that have a lot of zeros away from the three diagonals.
1:18
OK. So I'm shooting now for a formula for the determinant.
1:24
You remember we started with these three properties, three
1:30
simple properties, but out of that we got all these amazing facts, like the determinant of A B
1:37
equals determinant of A times determinant of B. But the three facts were --
1:45
oh, how about I just take two by twos. I know, because everybody here knows, the determinant of a two
1:52
by two matrix, but let's get it out of these three formulas.
1:57
OK, so here's my, my two by two matrix. I'm looking for a formula for this determinant.
2:04
a b c d, OK. So property one, I know what to do with the identity.
2:14
Right? Property two allows me to exchange rows, and I know what to do then.
2:20
So I know that that determinant is one. Property two allows me to exchange rows and know
2:27
that this determinant is minus one.
2:32
And now I want to use property three to get everybody,
2:37
to get everybody. And how will I do that? OK. So remember that if I keep the second row the same,
2:46
I'm allowed to use linearity in the first row.
2:52
And I'll just use it in a simple way. I'll write this vector a b as a 0 + 0 b.
3:02
So that's one step using property three, linearity
3:09
in the first row when the second row's the same. OK. But now you can guess what I'm going to do next.
3:15
I'll -- because I'd like to -- if I can make the matrices diagonal, then I'm clearly there.
3:22
So I'll take this one. Now I'll keep the first row fixed and split the second row,
3:28
so that'll be an a 0 and I'll split that into a c 0 and, keeping that first row the same, a 0 d.
3:39
I used, for this part, linearity. And now I'll -- whoops, that's plus because I've got more
3:47
coming. This one I'll do the same. I'll keep this first row the same
3:53
and I'll split c d into c 0 and 0 d.
3:59
OK. Now I've got four easy determinants, and two of them are --
4:05
well, all four are extremely easy. Two of them are so easy as to turn into zero, right?
4:12
Which two of these determinants are zero right away?
4:17
The first guy is zero. Why is he zero? Why is that determinant nothing, forget him?
4:26
Well, it has a column of zeros. And by the -- well, so one way to think is, well,
4:33
it's a singular matrix. Oh, for, for like forty-eight different reasons, that determinant is zero.
4:40
It's a singular matrix that has a column of zeros. It's, it's dead. And this one is about as dead too.
4:47
Column of zeros. OK. So that's leaving us with this one. Now what do I -- how do I know its determinant,
4:54
following the rules? Well, I guess one of the properties that we actually got
5:00
to was the determinant of that -- diagonal matrix, then --
5:07
so I, I'm finally getting to that determinant is the a d.
5:12
And this determinant is what? What's this one?
5:18
Minus -- because I would use property two to do a flip
5:23
to make it c b, then property three to factor out the b,
5:29
property c to factor out the c -- the property again to factor out the c, and that minus,
5:35
and of course finally I got the answer that we knew we would get.
5:42
But you see the method. You see the method, because it's method I'm looking for here,
5:48
not just a two by two answer but the method of doing -- now I can do three by threes and four by fours and any size.
5:59
So if you can see the method of taking each row at a time --
6:05
so let's -- what would happen with three by threes? Can we mentally do it rather than I write everything on the board for three by threes?
6:13
So what would we do if I had three by threes? I would keep rows two and three the same
6:20
and I would split the first row into how many pieces?
6:25
Three pieces. I'd have an A zero zero and a zero B zero and a zero zero C or something for the first row.
6:35
So I would instead of going from one piece to two pieces to four pieces, I would go from one piece to three pieces to --
6:48
what would it be? Each of those three, would, would it be nine?
6:54
Or twenty-seven? Oh yeah, I've actually got more steps, right.
6:59
I'd go to nine but then I'd have another row to straighten out, twenty-seven. Yes, oh God.
7:04
OK, let me say this again then. If I -- if it was three by three, I would --
7:10
separating out one row into three pieces would give me three, separating out the second row into three
7:16
pieces, then I'd be up to nine, separating out the third row into its three pieces, I'd be up to twenty-seven, three cubed,
7:24
pieces. But a lot of them would be zero. So now when would they not be zero?
7:31
Tell me the pieces that would not be zero. Now I will write the non-zero ones.
7:37
OK, so I have this matrix. I think I have to use these, start
7:43
using these double symbols here because otherwise I could never
7:50
do n by n. OK. OK. So I split this up like crazy.
7:57
A bunch of pieces are zero. Whenever I have a column of zeros, I know I've got zero.
8:06
When do I not have zero? When do I have -- what is it that's like these guys?
8:12
These are the survivors, two survivors there. So my question for three by three
8:18
is going to be what are the survivors? How many survivors are there? What are they?
8:24
And when do I get a survivor. Well, I would get a survivor --
8:30
for example, one survivor will be that one times that one times that one, with all zeros
8:35
everywhere else. That would be one survivor. a one one zero zero zero a two two zero zero
8:44
zero a three three. That's like the a d survivor.
8:50
Tell me another survivor. What other thing -- oh, now here you see the clue.
8:58
Now can -- shall I just say the whole clue? That I'm having -- the survivors have one entry from each row and each column.
9:10
One entry from each row and column. Because if some column is missing,
9:16
then I get a singular matrix. And that, that's one of these guys.
9:22
See, you see what happened with -- this guy? Column one never got used in 0 b 0 d.
9:32
So its determinant was zero and I forget it. So I'm going to forget those and just put -- so tell me one more that would be a survivor?
9:42
Well -- well, here's another one. a one one zero zero -- now OK, that's used up row -- row one
9:50
is used. Column one is already used so it better be zero.
9:57
What else could I have? Where could I pick the guy -- which column shall I use in row
10:03
two? Use column three, because here if I use column --
10:08
here I used column one and row one. This was like the column -- numbers were one two three, right in order.
10:15
Now the column numbers are going to be one three, column three,
10:23
and column two. So the row numbers are one two three, of course.
10:29
The column numbers are some -- OK, some permutation of one two three,
10:35
and here they come in the order one three two. It's just like having a permutation matrix
10:42
with, instead of the ones, with numbers. And actually, it's very close to having a permutation matrix,
10:50
because I, what I do eventually is I factor out these numbers and then I have got.
10:57
So what is that determinant equal? I factor those numbers out and I've got a one one times a two two times a three three.
11:05
And what does this determinant equal? Yeah, now tell me the, this -- I mean, we're really getting to the heart of these formulas
11:13
now. What is that determinant? By the laws of -- by, by our three properties,
11:20
I can factor these out, I can factor out the a one one, the a two three, and the a three two.
11:27
They're in separate rows. I can do each row separately. And then I just have to decide is that plus sign
11:35
or is that a minus sign? And the answer is it's a minus.
11:42
Why minus? Because these is one row exchange to get it back to the identity.
11:49
So that's a minus. Now I through? No, because there are other ways.
11:55
What I'm really through with, what
12:02
I've done, what I've, what I've completed is only the part where the a one one is there.
12:08
But now I've got parts where it's a one two.
12:15
And now if it's a one two that row is used, that column is used. You see that idea?
12:21
I could use this row and column. Now that column is used, that column is used,
12:28
and this guy has to be here, a three three. And what's that determinant?
12:33
That's an a one two times an a two one times an a three three,
12:38
and does it have a plus or a minus? A minus is right.
12:43
It has a minus. Because it's one flip away from an id- from the, regular, the right order, the diagonal order.
12:51
And now what's the other guy with a -- with, a one two up there?
12:57
I could have used this row. I could have put this guy here and this guy here.
13:05
Right? You see the whole deal? Now that's an a one two, a two three, a three one,
13:14
and does that go with a plus or a minus? Yeah, now that takes a minute of thinking,
13:19
doesn't it, because one row exchange doesn't get it in line.
13:24
So what is the answer for this? Plus or minus? Plus, because it takes two exchanges.
13:32
I could exchange rows one and three and then two and three. Two exchanges makes this thing a plus.
13:40
And then finally we have -- we're going to have two more. OK. Zero zero a one three, a two one zero zero, zero a three two
13:52
zero. And one more guy. Zero zero a one three, zero a two
14:00
two zero, A three one zero zero.
14:06
And let's put down what we get from those. An a one three, an a two one, and an a three two, and I
14:14
think that one is a plus. And this guys is a minus because one exchange would put it --
14:21
would order it. And that's a minus.
14:29
All right, that has taken one whole board just to do the three by three.
14:35
But do you agree that we now have a formula for the determinant which
14:42
came from the three properties? And it must be it.
14:50
And I'm going to keep that formula. That's a famous -- that three by three formula is one that
14:57
if, if the cameras will follow me back to the beginning here, I, I get the ones with the plus sign are the ones that go down
15:07
like down this way. And the ones with the minus signs are sort of the ones that go this way.
15:13
I won't make that precise. For two reasons, one, it would clutter up
15:20
the board, and second reason, it wouldn't be right for four by fours.
15:26
For four by four, let me just say right away, four by four matrix -- the, the cross diagonal,
15:33
the wrong diagonal happens to come out with a plus sign. Why is that?
15:39
If I have a four by four matrix with ones coming on the counter diagonal, that determinant is plus.
15:50
Why? Why plus for that guy? Because if I exchange rows one and four and then
15:59
I exchange rows two and three, I've got the identity, and I did two exchanges.
16:05
So this down to this, like, you know, down toward Miami
16:10
and down toward LA stuff is, like, three by three only.
16:16
OK. But I do want to get now --
16:25
I don't want to go through this for a four by four. I do want to get now the general formula.
16:34
So this is what I refer to in the book as the big formula.
16:39
So now this is the big formula for the determinant. I'm asking you to make a jump from two by two and three
16:47
by three to n by n. OK, so this will be the big formula.
17:00
That the determinant of A is the sum of a whole lot of terms.
17:07
And what are those terms? And, and is it a plus or a minus sign,
17:12
and I have to tell you which, which it is, because this came in -- in the three by three case,
17:18
I had how many terms? Six. And half were plus and half were minus.
17:25
How many terms are you figuring for four by four? If I get two terms in the two by two case, three --
17:36
six terms in the three by three case, what's that pattern?
17:41
How many terms in the four by four case?
17:46
Twenty-four. Four factorial.
17:52
Why four factorial? This will be a sum of n factorial terms.
18:00
Twenty-four, a hundred and twenty, seven hundred and twenty, whatever's after that.
18:05
OK. Half plus and half minus.
18:12
And where do those n factorial -- terms come from? This is the moment to listen to this lecture.
18:17
Where do those n factorial terms come from? They come because the first, the guy in the first row
18:23
can be chosen n ways. And after he's chosen, that's used up that, that column.
18:33
So the one in the second row can be chosen n minus one ways.
18:38
And after she's chosen, that second column has been used. And then the one in the third row can be chosen n minus two
18:46
ways, and after it's chosen -- notice how I'm getting these personal pronouns.
18:52
But I've run out. And I'm not willing to stop with three by three,
18:59
so I'm just going to write the formula down. So the one in the first row comes from some column alpha.
19:07
I don't know what alpha is. And the one in the -- I multiply that by somebody in the second row that comes
19:14
from some different column. And I multiply that by somebody in the third row who comes
19:19
from some yet different column. And then in the n-th row, I don't know what --
19:25
I don't know how to draw. Maybe omega, for last. And the whole point is then that --
19:32
that those column numbers are different, that alpha, beta, gamma, omega, that set of column numbers
19:40
is some permutation, permutation of one to n.
19:50
It, it, the n column numbers are each used once. And that gives us n factorial terms.
19:57
And when I choose a term, that means I'm choosing somebody from every row and column.
20:04
And then I just -- like the way I had this from row and column
20:10
one, row and column two, row and column three, so that -- what was the alpha beta stuff in that, for that term here?
20:19
Alpha was one, beta was two, gamma was three. The permutation was, was the trivial permutation, one
20:26
two three, everybody in the right order. You see that formula?
20:31
It's -- do you see why I didn't want to start with that
20:37
the first day, Friday? I'd rather we understood the properties.
20:42
Because out of this formula, presumably I could figure out all these properties.
20:47
How would I know that the determinant of the identity matrix was one, for example, out of this formula?
20:56
Why is -- if A is the identity matrix, how does this formula give me a plus one?
21:04
You see it, right? Because, because almost all the terms are zeros.
21:10
Which term isn't zero, if, if A is the identity matrix?
21:15
Almost all the terms are zero because almost all the As are zero. It's only, the only time I'll get something
21:21
is if it's a one one times a two two times a three three. Only, only the, only the permutation
21:28
that's in the right order will, will give me something. It'll come with a plus sign.
21:34
And the determinant of the identity is one. So, so we could go back from this formula and prove
21:40
everything. We could even try to prove that the determinant of A B was the determinant of A times the determinant of B.
21:48
But like next week we would still be working on it, because it's not --
21:54
clear from -- if I took A B, my God. You know --. The entries of A B would be all these pieces.
22:02
Well, probably, it's probably -- historically it's been done, but it won't be repeated in eighteen oh six.
22:09
OK. It would be possible probably to see, why the determinant of A
22:16
equals the determinant of A transpose. That was another, like, miracle property at the end. That would, that would, that's an easier
22:22
one, which we could find. OK. Is that all right for the big formula?
22:30
I could take you then a, a typical -- let me do an example.
22:36
Which I'll just create. I'll take a four by four matrix.
22:42
I'll put some, I'll put some ones in and some zeros in. OK. Let me --
22:48
I don't know how many to put in, to tell the truth. I've never done this before.
22:54
I don't know the determinant of that matrix.
23:02
So like mathematics is being done for the first time in, in front of your eyes.
23:07
What's the determinant? Well, a lot of -- there are twenty-four terms,
23:15
because it's four by four. Many of them will be zero, because I've got all those zeros there.
23:22
Maybe the whole determinant is zero. I mean, I -- is that a singular matrix?
23:29
That possibility definitely exists. I could, I could, So one way to do it would be elimination.
23:37
Actually, that would probably be a fairly reasonable way. I could use elimination, so I could use --
23:44
go back to those properties, that -- and use elimination, get down, eliminate it down, do I have a row of zeros
23:50
at the end of elimination? The answer is zero. I was thinking, shall I try this big formula?
23:58
OK. Let's try the big formula. How -- tell me one way I can go down the matrix, taking a one,
24:08
taking a one from every row and column, and make it to the end?
24:13
So it's -- I get something that isn't zero. Well, one way to do it, I could take that times that times
24:18
that times that times that. That would be one and, and, and I just said,
24:23
that comes in with what sign? Plus. That comes with a plus sign.
24:28
Because, because that permutation -- I've just written the permutation
24:35
about four three two one, and one exchange and a second exchange, two exchanges
24:40
puts it in the correct order.
24:46
Keep walking away, don't.... OK, we're executing a determinant formula here.
24:54
Uh as long as it's not periodic, of course.
25:07
If he comes back I'm in -- no. All right, all right.
25:13
OK, so that would give me a plus one.
25:21
All right. Are there any others? Well, of course we see another one here.
25:26
This times this times this times this strikes us right away. So that's the order three, the order --
25:34
let me make a little different mark here. Three two one four.
25:41
And is that a plus or a minus, three two one four?
25:48
Is that, is that permutation a plus or a minus permutation? It's a minus.
25:53
How do you see that? What exchange shall I do to get it in the right order?
25:59
If I exchange the one and the three I'm in the right orders, took one exchange to do it, so that would be a plus --
26:05
that would be a minus one. And now I don't know if there're any more here. Let's see.
26:10
Let me try again starting with this.
26:15
Now I've got to pick somebody from -- oh yeah, see, you see what's happening. If I I start there, OK, column three is used.
26:24
So then when I go to next row, I can't use that, I must use that. Now columns two and three are used.
26:30
When I come to this row I must use that. And then I must use that. So if I start there, this is the only one I get.
26:38
And similarly, if I start there, that's the only one I get. So what's the determinant?
26:45
What's the determinant? Zero. The determinant is zero for that case.
26:51
Because we, we were able to check the twenty-four terms. Twenty-two of them were zero.
26:57
One of them was plus one. One of them was minus one. Add up the twenty-four terms, zero is the answer.
27:04
OK. Well, I didn't know it would be zero, I -- because I wasn't, like, thinking ahead. I was a little scared, actually.
27:10
I said, that, apparition went by.
27:18
So and I don't know if the camera caught that. So whether the rest of the world will
27:23
realize that I was in danger or not, we don't know. But anyway, I guess he just wanted
27:29
to be sure that we got the right answer, which is determinant zero. And then that makes me think, OK, the matrix
27:36
must be, the matrix must be singular.
27:41
And then if the matrix is singular, maybe there's another way to see that it's singular, like find something in its null space.
27:47
Or find a combination of the rows that gives zero.
27:54
And like what d- what, what combination of those rows does give zero.
28:01
Suppose I add rows one and rows three. If I add rows one and rows three, what do I get?
28:08
I get a row of all ones. Then if I add rows two and rows four I get a row of all ones.
28:15
So row one minus row two plus row three minus row four is probably the zero row.
28:21
It's a singular matrix. And I could find something in its null space the same way.
28:27
That would be a combination of columns that gives zero. OK, there's an example. All right.
28:32
So that's, well, that shows two things. That shows how we get the twenty-four terms
28:39
and it shows the great advantage of having a lot of zeros in there. OK.
28:45
So we'll use this big formula, but I want to pick -- I want to go onward now to cofactors.
28:53
Onward to cofactors. Cofactors is a way of breaking up this big formula that
29:03
connects this n by n -- this is an n by n determinant that
29:08
we've just have a formula for, the big formula. So cofactors is a way to connect this n by n determinant to,
29:18
determinants one smaller. One smaller.
29:24
And the way we want to do it is actually going to show up in
29:29
this. Since the three by three is the one that we wrote out in full,
29:34
let's, let me do this three by -- so I'm talking about cofactors, and I'm going to start again
29:43
with three by three. And I'm going to take the, the exact formula,
29:51
and I'm just going to write it as a one one -- this is the determinant I'm writing.
29:59
I'm just going to say a one one times what? A one one times what?
30:04
And it's a one one times a two two a three three minus a two three a three two.
30:12
Then I've got the a one two stuff times something.
30:22
And I've got the a one three stuff times something. Do you see what I'm doing?
30:29
I'm taking our big formula and I'm saying, OK, choose column --
30:37
out of the first row, choose column one. And take all the possibilities.
30:43
And those extra factors will be what we'll call the cofactor, co meaning going with a one one.
30:51
So this in parenthesis are, these are in, the cofactors are in parens.
30:57
A one one times something.
31:05
And I figured out what that something was by just looking back -- if I can walk back here to the, to the a one one,
31:14
the one that comes down the diagonal minus the one that comes that way.
31:19
That's, those are the two, only two that used a one one. So there they are, one with a plus and one with a
31:26
minus. And now I can write in the -- I could look back and see what used a one two
31:33
and I can see what used a one three, and those will give me the cofactors of a one two and a one
31:38
three. Before I do that, what's this number, what is this cofactor?
31:45
What is it there that's multiplying a one one?
31:52
Tell me what a two two a three three minus a two three a three two is, for this --
31:59
do you recognize that? Do you recognize --
32:06
let's see, I can -- and I'll put it here. There's the a one one.
32:11
That's used column one. Then there's -- the other factors involved these other
32:17
columns.
32:25
This row is used. This column is used. So this the only things left to use are these.
32:32
And this formula uses them, and what's the, what's the cofactor?
32:39
Tell me what it is because you see it, and then -- I'll be happy you see what the idea of cofactors.
32:47
It's the determinant of this smaller guy.
32:52
A one one multiplies the determinant of this smaller guy. That gives me all the a one one part of the big formula.
33:02
You see that? This, the determinant of this smaller guy is a two two a three three minus a two three a three two.
33:10
In other words, once I've used column one and row one, what's left is all the ways to use the other n-1
33:20
columns and n-1 rows, one of each. All the other -- and that's the determinant of the smaller guy
33:28
of size n-1. So that's the whole idea of cofactors. And we just have to remember that with determinants we've
33:37
got pluses and minus signs to keep straight. Can we keep this next one straight?
33:43
Let's do the next one. OK, the next one will be when I use a one two.
33:51
I'll have left -- so I can't use that column any more, but I can use a two one and a two three and I can use a three
34:02
one and a three three. So this one gave me a one times that determinant.
34:08
This will give me a one two times this determinant, a two one a three three minus a two three a three one.
34:24
So that's all the stuff involving a one two. But have I got the sign right?
34:32
Is the determinant of that correctly given by that or is there a minus sign?
34:37
There is a minus sign. I can follow one of these. If I do that times that times that,
34:43
that was one that's showing up here, but it should have showed -- it should have been a minus.
34:52
So I'm going to build that minus sign into the cofactor.
34:58
So, so the cofactor -- so I'll put, put that minus sign in here.
35:04
So because the cofactor is going to be strictly the thing that multiplies the, the factor.
35:09
The factor is a one two, the cofactor is this, is the parens, the stuff in parentheses.
35:15
So it's got the minus sign built in. And if I did -- if I went on to the third guy, there w-
35:23
there'll be this and this, this and this. And it would take its determinant. It would come out plus the determinant.
35:31
So now I'm ready to say what cofactors are. So this would be a plus and a one three times its cofactor.
35:40
And over here we had plus a one one times this determinant.
35:45
But and there we had the a one two times its cofactor, but the -- so the point is the cofactor is either plus
35:53
or minus the determinant. So let me write that underneath them. What is the, what are cofactors?
36:00
The cofactor if any number aij, let's say.
36:09
This is, this is all the terms in the, in the big formula that
36:18
involve aij. We're especially interested in a1j, the first row, that's
36:25
what I've been talking about, but any row would be all right. All right, so --
36:30
what terms involve aij? So -- it's the determinant of the n minus one matrix --
36:42
with row i, column j erased.
36:51
So it's the, it's a matrix of size n-1 with --
37:00
of course, because I can't use this row or this column again. So I have the matrix all there.
37:08
But now it's multiplied by a plus or a minus. This is the cofactor, and I'm going to call that cij.
37:14
Capital, I use capital c just to,
37:19
just to emphasize that these are important and emphasize that they're, they're, they're
37:25
different from the (a)s. OK. So now is it a plus or is it a minus?
37:34
Because we see that in this case, for a one one it was a plus, for a one two I -- this is ij --
37:41
it was a minus. For this ij it was a plus.
37:46
So any any guess on the rule for plus or minus when we see those examples, ij equal one one or one three
37:55
was a plus? It sounds very like i+j odd or even.
38:04
That, that's doesn't surprise us, and that's the right answer. So it's a plus if i+j is even and it's a minus if i+j is odd.
38:17
38:24
So if I go along row one and look at the cofactors, I just take those determinants, those one smaller determinants,
38:32
and they come in order plus minus plus minus plus minus. But if I go along row two and, and, and take the cofactors
38:42
of sub-determinants, they would start with a minus, because the two one entry, two plus one is odd, so the --
38:52
like there's a pattern plus minus plus minus plus if it was
38:57
five by five, but then if I was doing a cofactor then this sign would be minus plus minus plus minus, plus minus plus --
39:06
it's sort of checkerboard.
39:12
OK.
39:17
OK. Those are the signs that, that are given by this rule, i+j even or odd.
39:24
And those are built into the cofactors. The thing is called a minor without th-
39:31
before you've built in the sign, but I don't care about those. Build in that sign and call it a cofactor.
39:39
So what's the cofactor formula? OK. What's the cofactor formula then? Let me come back to this board and say,
39:49
what's the cofactor formula?
39:58
Determinant of A is -- let's go along the first row.
40:04
It's a one one times its cofactor,
40:11
and then the second guy is a one two times its cofactor, and you just keep going to the end of the row,
40:19
a1n times its cofactor. So that's cofactor for --
40:24
along row one.
40:30
And if I went along row I, I would -- those ones would be
40:39
Is. That's worth putting a box over. That's the cofactor formula.
40:47
Do you see that -- actually, this would give me another way
40:53
I could have started the whole topic of determinants.
41:00
And some, some people might do it this -- choose to do it this way. Because the cofactor formula would
41:06
allow me to build up an n by n determinant out of n-1 sized determinants, build those out of n-2, and so on.
41:14
I could boil all the way down to one by ones. So what's the cofactor formula for two by two matrices?
41:21
Yeah, tell me that. What's the cofactor for us? Here is the, here is the world's smallest example, practically,
41:28
of a cofactor formula. OK. Let's go along row one.
41:35
I take this first guy times its cofactor. What's the cofactor of the one one entry?
41:44
d, because you strike out the one one row and column and you're left with d.
41:50
Then I take this guy, b, times its cofactor. What's the cofactor of b?
41:57
Is it c or it's -- minus c, because I strike out this guy,
42:03
I take that determinant, and then I follow the i+j rule
42:08
and I get a minus, I get an odd. So it's b times minus c.
42:13
OK, it worked. Of course it, it worked.
42:20
And the three by three works. So that's the cofactor formula, and that is, that's an --
42:28
that's a good formula to know, and now I'm feeling like, wow,
42:33
I'm giving you a lot of algebra to swallow here.
42:38
Last lecture gave you ten properties.
42:44
Now I'm giving you -- and by the way, those ten properties led us to a formula
42:50
for the determinant which was very important, and I haven't repeated it till now.
42:55
What was that? The, the determinant is the product of the pivots.
43:01
So the pivot formula is, is very important. The pivots have all this complicated mess already
43:07
built in. As you did elimination to get the pivots, you built in all this horrible stuff, quite efficiently.
43:17
Then the big formula with the n factorial terms, that's got all the horrible stuff spread out.
43:24
And the cofactor formula is like in between. It's got easy stuff times horrible stuff, basically.
43:35
But it's, it shows you, how to get determinants from smaller determinants, and that's the application that I
43:42
now want to make. So may I do one more example?
43:51
So I remember the general idea. But I'm going to use this cofactor formula for a matrix
43:59
-- so here is going to be my example. It's -- I promised in the, in the lecture,
44:07
outline at the very beginning to do an example. And let me do -- I'm going to pick tri-diagonal matrix of ones.
44:18
I could, I'm drawing here the four by four.
44:26
So this will be the matrix. I could call that A4.
44:34
But my real idea is to do n by n.
44:40
To do them all. So A -- I could -- everybody understands what A1 and A2 are.
44:49
Yeah. Maybe we should just do A1 and A2 and A3 just for --
44:54
so this is What's the determinant of A1? A4. What's the determinant of A1?
45:01
So, so what's the matrix A1 in this formula? It's just got that.
45:06
So the determinant is one. What's the determinant of A2? So it's just got this two by two, and its determinant is --
45:14
zero. And then the three by three.
45:22
Can we see its determinant? Can you take the determinant of that three by three?
45:27
Well, that's not quite so obvious, at least not to me.
45:32
Being three by three, I don't know -- so here's a, here's a good example. How would you do that three by three determinant?
45:39
We've got, like, n factorial different ways. Well, three factorial. So we've got six ways.
45:45
OK. I mean, one way to do it -- actually the way I would probably
45:51
do it, being three by three, I would use the complete the big formula. I would say, I've got a one from that,
45:57
I've got a zero from that, I've got a zero from that, a zero from that, and this direction is a minus one,
46:03
that direction's a minus one. I believe the answer is minus one. Would you do it another way?
46:14
Here's another way to do it, look. Subtract row three from -- I'm just looking at this three by
46:19
three. Everybody's looking at the three by three. Subtract row three from row two.
46:25
Determinant doesn't change. So those become zeros. OK, now use the cofactor formula.
46:31
How's that? How can, how -- if this was now zeros and I'm looking at this three by three, use the cofactor formula.
46:39
Why not use the cofactor formula along that row?
46:45
Because then I take that number times its cofactor, so I take this number -- let me put a box around it --
46:52
times its cofactor, which is the determinant of that and that, which is what?
47:02
That two by two matrix has determinant one. So what's the cofactor?
47:08
What's the cofactor of this guy here?
47:15
Looking just at this three by three. The cofactor of that one is this determinant,
47:21
which is one times negative.
47:26
So that's why the answer came out minus one. OK. So I did the three by three.
47:32
I don't know if we want to try the four by four. Yeah, let's -- I guess that was the point of my example,
47:38
of course, so I have to try it. Sorry, I'm in a good mood today, so you have
47:44
to stand for all the bad jokes. OK. OK. So what was the matrix?
47:50
Ah. OK, now I'm ready for four by four.
47:57
Who wants to -- who wants to guess the, the -- I don't know, frankly, this four by four,
48:04
what's, what's the determinant. I plan to use cofactors.
48:12
OK, let's use cofactors. The determinant of A4 is --
48:17
OK, let's use cofactors on the first row. Those are easy. So I multiply this number, which is a convenient one,
48:25
times this determinant. So it's, it's one times the, this three by three
48:31
determinant. Now what is -- do you recognize that matrix? It's A3.
48:37
So it's one times the determinant of A3. Coming along this row is a one times this determinant,
48:46
and it goes with a plus, right? And then we have this one.
48:53
And what is its cofactor? Now I'm looking at, now I'm looking at this three
48:58
by three, this three by three, so I'm looking at the three by three that I haven't X-ed out.
49:04
What is that -- oh, now it, we did a plus or a -- is it plus this determinant, this three by three
49:10
determinant, or minus it? It's minus it, right, because this is --
49:16
I'm starting in a one two position, and that's a minus. So I want minus this determinant.
49:22
But these guys are X-ed out. OK. So I've got a three by three. Well, let's use cofactors again.
49:31
Use cofactors of the column, because actually we could use cofactors of columns just as well as rows, because, because the transpose rule.
49:39
So I'll take this one, which is now sitting in the plus position, times its determinant -- oh!
49:46
Oh, hell. What -- oh yeah, I shouldn't have said hell,
49:53
because it's all right. OK. One times the determinant. What is that matrix now that I'm taking
50:00
the, this smaller one of? Oh, but there's a minus, right? The minus came from, from the fact
50:05
that this was in the one two position and that's odd. So this is a minus one times -- and what's --
50:14
and then this one is the upper left, that's the one one position in its matrix, so plus.
50:21
And what's this matrix here? Do you recognize that? That matrix is --
50:28
yes, please say it -- A2.
50:36
And we -- that's our formula for any case. A of any size n is equal to the determinant of A n minus one,
50:46
that's what came from taking the one in the upper corner, the first cofactor, minus the determinant of A n minus two.
50:55
What we discovered there is true for all n.
51:02
I didn't even mention it, but I stopped taking cofactors when I got this one. Why did I stop?
51:08
Why didn't I take the cofactor of this guy? Because he's going to get multiplied by zero, and no,
51:16
no use wasting time. Or this one too. The cofactor, her cofactor will be
51:22
whatever that determinant is, but it'll be multiplied by zero, so I won't bother. OK, there is the formula.
51:30
And that now tells us -- I could figure out what A4 is now. Oh yeah, finally I can get A4.
51:37
Because it's A3, which is minus one, minus A2, which is zero,
51:43
so it's minus one. You see how we're getting kind of numbers
51:50
that you might not have guessed. So our sequence right now is one zero minus one minus one.
51:55
What's the next one in the sequence, A5? A5 is this minus this, so it is zero.
52:06
What's A6? A6 is this minus this, which is one.
52:15
What's A7? I'm, I'm going to be stopped by either the time runs out
52:21
or the board runs out. OK, A7 is this minus this, which is one.
52:27
I'll stop here, because time is out, but let me tell you what we've got. What -- these determinants have this series,
52:35
one zero minus one minus one zero one, and then it starts repeating.
52:42
It's pretty fantastic. These determinants have period six.
52:48
So the determinant of A sixty-one would be the determinant of A1, which would be one.
52:55
OK. I hope you liked that example. A non-trivial example of a tri-diagonal determinant.
53:04
Thanks. See you on Wednesday.
