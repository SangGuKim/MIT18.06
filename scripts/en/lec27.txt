OK, this is the lecture on positive definite matrices.
0:14
I made a start on those briefly in a previous lecture.
0:20
One point I wanted to make was the way that this topic brings
0:26
the whole course together, pivots, determinants, eigenvalues, and something new- four plot instability
0:36
and then something new in this expression, x transpose Ax,
0:42
actually that's the guy to watch in this lecture. So, so the topic is positive definite matrix,
0:50
and what's my goal? First, first goal is, how can I tell if a matrix is
0:58
positive definite? So I would like to have tests to see if you give me a, a five by five matrix,
1:06
how do I tell if it's positive definite? More important is, what does it mean?
1:12
Why are we so interested in this property of positive definiteness? And then, at the end comes some geometry.
1:21
Ellipses are connected with positive definite things. Hyperbolas are not connected with positive definite things,
1:28
so we- it's this, we, there's a geometry too, but mostly it's linear algebra and --
1:38
this application of how do you recognize 'em when you have a minim is pretty neat.
1:45
OK. I'm gonna begin with two by two. All matrices are symmetric, right?
1:52
That's understood; the matrix is symmetric, now my question is, is it positive definite?
2:00
Now, here are some -- each one of these is a complete test for positive definiteness.
2:09
If I know the eigenvalues, my test is are they positive?
2:15
Are they all positive? If I know these --
2:21
so, A is really -- I look at that number A, here, as the, as the one
2:27
by one determinant, and here's the two by two determinant.
2:33
So this is the determinant test. This is the eigenvalue test, this is the determinant test.
2:39
Are the determinants growing in s- of all, of all end, sort of,
2:46
can I call them leading submatrices, they're the first ones the northwest,
2:52
Seattle submatrices coming down from from there, they all, all those determinants have to be positive,
2:59
and then another test is the pivots. The pivots of a two by two matrix
3:06
are the number A for sure, and, since the product
3:13
is the determinant, the second pivot must be the determinant divided by A.
3:18
And then in here is gonna come my favorite and my new idea,
3:24
the, the, the the one to catch, about x transpose Ax
3:30
being positive. But we'll have to look at this guy. This gets, like a star, because for most, presentations,
3:42
the definition of positive definiteness would be this number four and these numbers one two three
3:49
would be test four. OK. Maybe I'll tuck this, where, you know,
3:56
OK. So I'll have to look at this x transpose Ax. Can you, can we just be sure, how
4:07
do we know that the eigenvalue test and the determinant test,
4:13
pick out the same matrices, and let me, let's just do a few examples.
4:19
Some examples. Let me pick the matrix two, six, six, tell me,
4:31
what number do I have to put there for the matrix
4:36
to be positive definite? Tell me a sufficiently large number
4:42
that would make it positive definite? Let's just practice with these conditions in the two
4:47
by two case. Now, when I ask you that, you don't wanna find the eigenvalues, you would use the determinant test
4:56
for that, so, the first or the pivot test, that, that guy is certainly positive, that had to happen,
5:03
and it's OK. How large a number here -- the number had better be more than
5:09
what? More than eighteen, right, because if it's eight --
5:14
no. More than what? Nineteen, is it?
5:21
If I have a nineteen here, is that positive definite?
5:28
I get thirty eight minus thirty six, that's OK.
5:36
If I had an eighteen, let me play it really close. If I have an eighteen there, then I positive definite?
5:44
Not quite. I would call this guy positive, so it's useful just to see that this the borderline.
5:53
That matrix is on the borderline, I would call that matrix positive semi-definite.
5:58
6:04
And what are the eigenvalues of that matrix, just since we're given eigenvalues of two by twos,
6:11
when it's semi-definite, but not definite, then the --
6:19
I'm squeezing this eigenvalue test down, -- what's the eigenvalue that I know this matrix has?
6:28
What kind of a matrix have I got here? It's a singular matrix, one of its eigenvalues is zero.
6:37
That has an eigenvalue zero, and the other eigenvalue is --
6:43
from the trace, twenty. OK. So that, that matrix has eigenvalues greater than
6:51
or equal to zero, and it's that "equal to" that brought this word "semi-definite" in.
6:58
And, the what are the pivots of that matrix? So the pivots, so the eigenvalues
7:03
are zero and twenty, the pivots are, well, the pivot is two,
7:10
and what's the next pivot?
7:15
There isn't one. We got a singular matrix here, it'll only have one pivot.
7:20
You see that that's a rank one matrix, two six is a -- six eighteen is a multiple of two six,
7:27
the matrix is singular it only has one pivot, so the pivot test doesn't quite
7:38
The -- let me do the x transpose Ax. pass. Now this is --
7:45
the novelty now. OK. What I looking at when I look at this new combination,
7:54
x transpose Ax. x is any vector now, so lemme compute, so any vector,
8:02
lemme call its components x1 and x2, so that's x.
8:08
And I put in here A. Let's, let's use this example two six, six eighteen,
8:15
and here's x transposed, so x1 x2. We're back to real matrices, after that last lecture
8:25
that- that said what to do in the complex case, let's come back to real matrices.
8:32
So here's x transpose Ax, and what I'm interested in is, what do I get if I multiply those together?
8:42
I get some function of x1 and x2, and what is it?
8:48
Let's see, if I do this multiplication, so I do it, lemme, just, I'll just do it slowly, x1, x2,
8:55
if I multiply that matrix, this is 2x1, and 6x2s,
9:01
and the next row is 6x1s and 18x2s,
9:07
and now I do this final step and what do I have? I've got 2x1 squareds, got 2X1 squareds
9:16
is coming from this two, I've got this one gives me eighteen,
9:23
well, shall I do the ones in the middle? How many x1 x2s do I have?
9:29
Let's see, x1 times that 6x2 would be six of 'em, and then x2 times this one will be six more, I get twelve.
9:38
So, in here is going, this is the number a, this is
9:44
the number 2b, and in here is -- x2 times eighteen x2 will be eighteen x2 squareds and this
9:54
is the number c. So it's ax1 -- it's like ax squared.
10:02
2bxy and cy squared. For my first point that I wanted to make by just doing out
10:11
a multiplication is, that is as soon as you give me the matrix, as soon as you give me the matrix, I can --
10:19
those are the numbers that appear in -- I'll call this thing a quadratic,
10:25
you see, it's not linear anymore. Ax is linear, but now I've got an x transpose coming
10:32
in, I'm up to degree two, up to degree two, maybe quadratic is the --
10:38
use the word. A quadratic form. It's purely degree two, there's no linear part,
10:46
there's no constant part, there certainly no cubes or fourth powers, it's all second degree.
10:53
And my question is -- is that quantity positive or not?
11:00
That's -- for every x1 and x2, that is my new definition --
11:08
that's my definition of a positive definite matrix. If this quantity is positive, if, if, if, it's positive
11:17
for all x's and y's, all x1 x2s, then I call them --
11:25
then that's the matrix is positive definite. Now, is this guy passing our test?
11:34
Well we have, we anticipated the answer here by, by asking first about eigenvalues and pivots,
11:42
and what happened? It failed. It barely failed.
11:49
If I had made this eighteen down to a seven, it would've totally failed.
11:58
I do that with the eraser, and then I'll put back eighteen, because, seven is such a total disaster, but if --
12:07
I'll keep seven for a second. Is that thing in any way positive definite?
12:15
No, absolutely not. I don't know its eigenvalues, but I know for sure one of them
12:21
is negative. Its pivots are two and then the next pivot would be
12:28
the determinant over two, and the determinant is -- what, what's the determinant of this thing?
12:35
Fourteen minus thirty six, I've got a determinant minus twenty two. The next pivot will be -- the pivots now,
12:43
of this thing are two and minus eleven or something.
12:48
Their product being minus twenty two the determinant. This thing is not positive definite.
12:53
What would be -- let me look at the x transpose Ax for this guy. What's -- if I do out this multiplication,
13:00
this eighteen is temporarily changing to a seven. This eighteen is temporarily changing to a seven,
13:08
and I know that there's some numbers x1 and x2
13:16
for which that thing, that function, is negative.
13:24
And I'm desperately trying to think what they are. Maybe you can see.
13:30
Can you tell me a value of x1 and x2 that makes this quantity negative?
13:36
Oh, maybe one and minus one?
13:43
Yes, that's -- in this case, that, will work, right,
13:49
if I took x1 to be one, and x2 to be minus one, then I always get something positive, the two,
13:57
and the seven minus one squared, but this would be minus twelve and the whole thing would be negative;
14:02
I would have two minus twelve plus seven, a negative. If I drew the graph, can I get the little picture in
14:11
here? If I draw the graph of this thing? So, graphs, of the function f(x,y), or f(x),
14:22
so I say here f(x,y) equal this -- x transpose Ax, this,
14:29
this this ax squared, 2bxy, and cy squared. And, let's take the example, with these numbers.
14:46
OK, so here's the x axis, here's the y axis, and here's --
14:54
up is the function. z, if you like, or f. I apologize, and let me, just once in my life here,
15:03
put an arrow over these, these, axes so you see them. That's the vector and I just, see, instead of x1 and x2,
15:13
I made them x- the components x and y. OK. So, so, what's a graph of 2x squared, twelve xy, and seven y
15:23
squared? I'd like to see -- I not the greatest artist, but let's --
15:31
tell me something about this graph of this function.
15:38
Whoa, tell me one point that it goes through.
15:44
The origin. Right?
15:50
Even this artist can get this thing to go through the origin,
15:56
when these are zero, I, I certainly get zero. OK. Some more points.
16:02
If x is one and y is zero, then I'm going upwards, so I'm going up this way, and I'm, I'm
16:09
going up, like, two x squared in that direction. So -- that's meant to be a parabola.
16:14
And, suppose x stays zero and y increases.
16:23
Well, y could be positive or negative; it's seven y squared. Is this function going upward?
16:30
In the x direction it's going upward, and in the y direction
16:35
it's going upwards, and if x equals y then the forty-five degree direction is certainly
16:42
going upwards; because then we'd have what, about, everything would be positive, but what?
16:49
This function -- what's the graph of this function?
16:54
Look like? Tell me the word that describes the graph of this function.
17:00
This is the non-positive definite here, everybody's with me here, for some reason
17:07
got started in a negative direction, your case that isn't positive definite.
17:12
And what's the graph look like that goes up, but does it -- do we have a minimum here, does it go from, from the origin?
17:22
Completely? No, because we just checked that this thing failed.
17:28
It failed along the direction when x was minus y -- we have a saddle point, let me put myself, let me,
17:37
to the least, tell you the word. This thing, goes up in some directions,
17:46
but down in other directions, and if we actually knew what
17:53
a saddle looked like or thinks saddles do that --
17:59
the way your legs go is, like, down, up, the way, you,
18:06
looking like, forward, and, the, and drawing the thing is even
18:16
worse than describing -- I'm just going to say in some directions we go up and in other directions, there is, a saddle --
18:28
Now I'm sorry I put that on the front board, you have no way to cover it, but it's a saddle.
18:34
OK. And, and this is a saddle point, it's the, it's the point that's at the maximum in some directions
18:43
and at the minimum in other directions. And actually, the perfect directions to look
18:50
are the eigenvector directions. We'll see that. So this is, not a positive definite matrix.
19:03
OK. Now I'm coming back to this example, getting rid of this seven, let's move it up to twenty.
19:14
Let's, let's let's make the thing really positive definite. OK.
19:19
So this is, this number's now twenty. c is now twenty. OK.
19:24
Now that passes the test, which I haven't proved, of course,
19:30
it passes the test for positive pivots. It passes the test for positive eigenvalues.
19:40
How can you tell that the eigenvalues of that matrix are positive without actually finding them?
19:45
Of course, two by two I could find them, but can you see -- how do I know they're positive?
19:51
I know that their product is -- I know that lambda one times lambda two is positive, why?
19:58
Because that's the determinant, right, lambda one times lambda two is the determinant, which is forty
20:06
minus thirty-six is four. So the determinant is four.
20:11
And the trace, the sum down the diagonal, is twenty-two.
20:16
So, they multiply to give four. So that leaves the possibility they're either
20:22
both positive or both negative. But if they're both negative, the trace couldn't be
20:29
So they're both positive. twenty-two. So both of the eigenvalues that are positive, both of the pivots are positive --
20:36
the determinants are positive, and I believe that this function is positive everywhere except at zero, zero,
20:47
of course. When I write down this condition,
20:52
So I believe that x transposed, let me copy, x transpose Ax is positive, except, of course,
21:00
at the minimum point, at zero, of course,
21:07
I don't expect miracles. So what does its graph look like, and how do I check,
21:15
and how do I check that this really is positive?
21:22
So we take it's graph for a minute. What would be the graph of that function -- it does not have a saddle point.
21:29
Let me -- I'll raise the board, here, and stay with this example for a while.
21:36
So I want to do the graph of -- here's my function, two x squared, twelve xy-s, that could be positive or negative,
21:46
and twenty y squared. But my point is, so you're seeing the underlying point is,
21:56
that, the things are positive definite when in some way, these, these pure squares, squares
22:05
we know to be positive, and when those kind of overwhelm this guy, who could be m- positive or negative,
22:13
because some like or have same or have same or different signs, when these are big enough
22:19
they overwhelm this guy and make the total thing positive, and what would the graph now look like?
22:25
Let me draw the x - well, let me draw the x direction, the y
22:32
direction, and the origin, at zero, zero, I'm there,
22:40
where do I go as I move away from the origin? Where do I go as I move away from the origin?
22:50
I'm sure that I go up. The origin, the center point here,
22:56
is a minim because this thing I believe, and we better see why,
23:01
it's, the graph is like a bowl, the graph is like a bowl shape,
23:07
it's -- here's the minimum.
23:15
And because we've got a pure quadratic, we know it sits at the origin, we know it's tangent plane,
23:23
the first derivatives are zero, so, we know, first derivatives,
23:30
First derivatives are all zero, but that's
23:37
not enough for a minimum. It's first derivatives were zero here.
23:43
So, the partial derivatives, the first derivatives, are zero.
23:51
Again, because first derivatives are gonna have an x or an a y,
23:56
or a y in them, they'll be zero at the origin. It's the second derivatives that control everything.
24:03
It's the second derivatives that this matrix is telling us, and somehow --
24:10
here's my point. You remember in Calculus, how did you decide on a minimum?
24:16
First requirement was, that the derivative had to be zero. But then you didn't know if you had a minimum or a maximum.
24:25
To know that you had a minimum, you had to look at the second derivative. The second derivative had to be positive,
24:33
the slope had to be increasing as you went through the minimum point.
24:40
The curvature had to go upwards, and that's what we're doing now in two dimensions,
24:46
and in n dimensions. So we're doing what we did in Calculus.
24:52
Second derivative positive, m- will now become that the matrix of second derivatives
24:58
is positive definite. Can I just -- like a translation of --
25:05
this is how minimum are coming in, ithe beginning of Calculus
25:11
-- we had a minimum was associated with second derivative,
25:22
being positive. And first derivative zero, of course. Derivative, first derivative, but it
25:36
was the second derivative that told us we had a minimum. And now, in 18.06, in linear algebra,
25:43
we'll have a minim for our function now, our function will have, for your function be a function not
25:53
of just x but several variables, the way functions really
26:00
are in real life, the minimum will be when the matrix of second derivatives, the matrix
26:15
here was one by one, there was just one second derivative, now we've got lots.
26:20
Is positive definite.
26:29
So positive for a number translates into positive definite for a matrix.
26:34
And it this brings everything you check pivots, you check determinants, you check all your values,
26:41
or you check this minimum stuff. OK. Let me come back to this graph.
26:49
That graph goes upwards. And I'll have to see why.
26:54
How do I know that this, that this function is always positive?
26:59
Can you look at that and tell that it's always positive? Maybe two by two, you could feel pretty sure,
27:08
but what's the good way to show that this thing is always
27:14
If we can express it, as, in terms of squares, positive?
27:20
because that's what we know for any x and y, whatever, if we're squaring something
27:26
we certainly are not negative. So I believe that this expression, this function,
27:32
could be written as a sum of squares. Can you tell me --
27:41
see, because all the problems, the headaches are coming from this xy term.
27:47
If we can get expressions -- if we can get that inside a square, so actually, what we're doing is something
27:53
called, that you've seen called completing the square. Let me start the square and you complete it.
28:01
OK, I think we have two of x plus, now I don't remember how many y-s we need, but you'll
28:09
figure it out, squared. How many y-s should I put in here, to make --
28:20
what do I want to do, the two x squared-s will be correct, right?
28:25
What I want to do is put in the right number of y-s to get the twelve xy correct.
28:33
And what is that number of y-s? Let's see, I've got two times, and so
28:39
I really want six xy-s to come out of here, I think maybe if I put three there,
28:44
does that look right to you? I have two- this is, we can mentally, multiply out,
28:53
that's X squared, that's right, that's six X Y, times the two gives from, right,
28:59
and how many Y squareds have I now got? How many Y squareds have I now got from this term?
29:05
Eighteen. Eighteen was the key number, remember?
29:12
Now if I want to make it twenty, then I've got two left. Two y squared-s.
29:18
That's completing the square, and it's, now
29:25
I can see that that function is positive, because it's all squares.
29:33
I've got two squares, added together, I couldn't go negative. What if I went back to that seven?
29:42
If instead of twenty that number was a seven, then what would happen?
29:47
This would still be correct, I'd still have this square, to get the two x squared and the twelve xy,
29:53
and I'd have eighteen y squared and then what would I do here?
29:58
I'd have to remove eleven y squared-s, right, if I only had a seven here, then instead of --
30:08
when I had a twenty I had two more to put in, when I had an eighteen, which was the marginal case,
30:16
I had no more to put in. When I had a seven, which was the case below zero,
30:23
the indefinite case, I had minus eleven.
30:29
Now, so, you can see now, that this thing is a bowl.
30:36
OK. It's going upwards, if I cut it at a plane, z equal to one,
30:42
say, I would get, I would get a curve, what would
30:47
be the equation for that curve? If I cut it at height one, the equation
30:53
would be this thing equal to one. And that curve would be an ellipse.
30:59
So actually, already, I've blocked into the lecture, the different pieces that we're aiming for.
31:09
We're aiming for the tests, which this passed; we're aiming for the connection to a minimum, which this --
31:17
which we see in the graph, and if we chop it up,
31:22
if we set this thing equal to one, if I set that thing equal to one, that --
31:27
what that gives me is, the cross-section. It gives me this, this curve, and its equation
31:37
is this thing equals one, and that's an ellipse. Whereas if I cut through a saddle point,
31:44
I get a hyperbola. But this minimum stuff is really what I'm most interested
31:53
OK. in. OK. By -- I just have to ask, do you recognize, I mean,
32:00
these numbers here, the two that appeared outside, the three that appeared inside, the two that appeared there --
32:08
actually, those numbers come from elimination.
32:13
Completing the square is our good old method
32:18
of Gaussian elimination, in expressed
32:24
in terms of these squares. The -- let me show you what I mean.
32:30
I just think those numbers are no accident, If I take my matrix two, six, six, and twenty,
32:40
and I do elimination, then the pivot is two and I take three, what's the multiplier?
32:50
How much of row one do I take away from row two? Three.
32:55
So what you're seeing in this, completing the square, is the pivots outside and the multiplier inside.
33:05
Just do that again? The pivot is two, three -- three of those away from that gives
33:12
me two, six, zero, and what's the second pivot?
33:18
Three of this away from this, three sixes'll be eighteen, and the second pivot will also be a
33:23
two. So that's the U, this is the A, and of course the L
33:32
was one, zero, one, and the multiplier was three.
33:37
So, completing the square is elimination.
33:48
Why I happy to see, happy to see that coming together?
33:54
Because I know about elimination for m by m matrices.
34:01
I just started talking about completing the square, here,
34:07
for two by twos. But now I see what's going on.
34:12
Completing the square really amounts to splitting this thing into a sum of squares, so what's the critical thing --
34:21
I have a lot of squares, and inside those squares are multipliers but they're squares,
34:28
and the question is, what's outside these squares? When I complete the square, what are the numbers that go
34:35
outside? They're the pivots. They're the pivots, and that's why positive pivots give me
34:45
sum of squares. Positive pivots, those pivots are the numbers that go outside the squares, so positive pivots,
34:53
sum of squares, everything positive, graph goes up, a minimum at the origin, it's all connected together;
35:03
all connected together. And in the two by two case, you can see those connections,
35:08
but linear algebra now can go up to three by three, m by m.
35:16
Let's do that next. Can I just, before I leave two by two, I've written this expression "matrix of second derivatives."
35:24
What's the matrix of second derivatives? That's one second derivative now,
35:31
but if I'm in two dimensions, I have a two by two matrix,
35:40
it's the second x derivative, the second x derivative goes
35:46
there -- shall I write it -- fxx, if you like, fxx,
35:56
that means the second derivative of f in the x direction. fyy, second derivative in the y direction.
36:04
Those are the pure derivatives, second derivatives. They have to be positive.
36:10
For a minimum. This number has to be positive for a minimum. That number has to be positive for a minimum.
36:17
But, that's not enough. Those numbers have to somehow be big enough
36:23
to overcome this cross-derivative,
36:30
Why is the matrix symmetric? Because the second derivative f with respect to x and y is
36:35
equal to -- I can, that's the beautiful fact about second derivatives, is
36:42
I can do those in either order and I get the same thing. So this is the same as that, and so, that's
36:54
the matrix of second derivatives. And the test is, it has to be positive definite.
37:01
You might remember, from, tucked in somewhere near the end of eighteen o' two or at least in the book,
37:08
was the condition for a minimum, For a function of two variables.
37:15
Let's -- when do you have a minimum? For a function of two variables, believe me, that's what Calculus is for.
37:24
The condition is first derivatives have to be zero.
37:29
And the matrix of second derivatives has to be positive definite.
37:35
So you maybe remember there was an fxx times an fyy that had to be bigger than an an fxy squared,
37:42
that's just our determinant, two by two. But now, we now know the answer for three by three,
37:51
m by m, because we can do elimination by m by m matrices,
37:57
we can connect eigenvalues of m by m matrices, we can do sum of squares, sum of m squares instead of only two
38:06
squares; and so let's take a, let
38:11
me go over here to do a three by three example.
38:17
So, three by three example.
38:23
OK. Oh, let me --
38:29
shall I use my favorite matrix?
38:34
You've seen this matrix before.
38:45
Yes, let's use the good matrix, four by one, oops, open.
38:56
Is that matrix positive definite?
39:01
What's -- so I'm going to ask questions about this matrix, is it positive definite, first of all?
39:08
What's the function associated with that matrix, what's the x transpose Ax?
39:16
Is -- do we have a minimum for that function, at zero?
39:22
And then even what's the geometry? OK. First of all, is the matrix positive definite,
39:29
now I've given you the numbers there so you can take the determinants, maybe that's the quickest,
39:35
is that what you would do mentally, if I give you all a matrix on a quiz and say is it positive definite or not?
39:43
I would take that determinant and I'd give the answer two. I would take that determinant and I
39:49
would give the answer for that two by two determinant,
39:55
I'd give the answer three, and anybody remember the answer for the three by three determinant?
40:04
It was four, you remember for these special matrices, when we do determinants, they went up two, three, four, five,
40:13
six, they just went up linearly. So that matrix has -- the determinants are two, three,
40:22
and four. Pivots. What are the pivots for that matrix?
40:31
I'll tell you, they're -- the first pivot is two, the next pivot is three over two,
40:37
the next pivot is four over three.
40:42
Because, the product of the pivots has to give me those determinants. The product of these two pivots gives me that determinant;
40:50
the product of all the pivots gives me that determinant. What are the eigenvalues?
41:03
Oh, I don't know.
41:08
The eigenvalues I've got, what do I have a cubic equation -- a degree three equation?
41:14
There are three eigenvalues to find.
41:19
If I believe what I've said today,
41:25
what do I know about these eigenvalues, even though I don't know the exact numbers.
41:30
I -- I remember the numbers.
41:37
Because these matrices are so important that people figure them.
41:43
But -- what do you believe to be true about these three eigenvalues -- you believe that they are all positive.
41:52
They're all positive. I think that they are two minus square root of two, two,
42:00
and two plus the square root of two. I think. Let me just -- I can't write those numbers down without checking
42:08
the simple checks, what the first simple check is the trace, so if I add those numbers I get six
42:15
and if I add those numbers I get six. The other simple test is the determinant, if I --
42:24
can you do this, can you multiply those numbers together?
42:29
I guess we can multiply by two out there. What's two minus square root of two times two
42:35
plus square root of two, that'll be four minus two, that'll be two, yeah, two times two,
42:41
that's got the determinant, right, so it's got, it's got a chance of being correct and I think it is.
42:49
Now, what's the x transpose Ax? I better give myself enough room for that. x transpose Ax for this guy.
42:59
It's two x1 squareds, and two x2 squareds, and two x3 squareds.
43:07
Those come from the diagonal, those were easy. Now off the diagonal there's a minus and a minus,
43:13
they come together there'll be a minus two minus two whats?
43:20
Are coming from this one two and two one position, is the x1 x2.
43:26
I'm doing mentally a multiplication of this matrix times a row vector
43:34
on the left times a column vector on the right, and I know that these numbers show up in the answer.
43:41
The diagonal is the perfect square, this off diagonal is a minus two x1 x2,
43:49
and there are no x1 x3-s, and there're minus two x2 x3-s.
43:55
And I believe that that expression is always positive.
44:01
I believe that that curve, that graph, really, of that function, this is my function f,
44:09
and I'm in more dimensions now than I can draw, it --
44:14
but the graph of that function goes upwards.
44:20
It's a bowl. Or maybe the right word is --
44:26
just forgot, what's a long word for bowl?
44:34
Hm, maybe paraboloid, I think, paraboloid comes in.
44:42
I'll edit the tape and get that word in. Bowl, let's say, is, that, so that, and if I can --
44:54
I could complete the squares, I could write that as the sum of three squares, and those three squares
44:59
would get multiplied by the three pivots. And the pivots are all positive.
45:05
So I would have positive pivots times squares, the net result would be a positive function
45:11
and a bowl which goes upwards. And then, finally, if I cut -- if I slice through this bowl,
45:19
if I -- now I'm asking you to stretch your visualization here, because I'm in four dimensions,
45:26
I've got x1 x2 x3 in the base, and this function is z, or f,
45:33
or something. And its graph is going up. But I'm in four dimensions, because I've got three
45:40
in the base and then the upward direction, but now if I cut through this four-dimensional picture,
45:49
at level one, so, suppose I cut through this thing
45:55
at height one. So I take all the points that are at height one.
46:01
That gives me --
46:07
it gave me an ellipse over there, in that two by two case,
46:14
in this case, this will be the equation of an ellipsoid,
46:19
a football in other words. Well, not quite a football.
46:25
A lopsided football. What would be, can I try to describe to you what
46:30
the ellipsoid will look like, this ellipsoid, I'm sorry that the, that I've ended the matrix right --
46:40
at the point, let's -- let me be sure you've seen the equation.
46:46
Two x1 squared, two x2 squared, two x3 squared, minus two of the cross parts, equal what?
46:57
That is the equation of a football, so what do I mean by a football or an ellipsoid?
47:03
I mean that, well, I'll draw a few.
47:12
It's like that, it's got a center,
47:21
and it's got it's got three principal directions.
47:31
This ellipsoid. So -- you see what I'm saying, if we have a sphere then all directions would be the same.
47:39
If we had a true football, or it's closer to a rugby ball,
47:44
really, because it's more curved than a football, it would have one long direction and the other two
47:52
would be equal. That would be like having a matrix that had one eigenvalue repeated.
47:59
And then one other different. So this sphere comes from, like, the identity matrix,
48:04
all eigenvalues the same. Our rugby ball comes from a case where --
48:12
three, the three, two of the three eigenvalues are the same. But we know how the case where -- the typical case,
48:20
where the three eigenvalues were all different. So this will have --
48:25
How do I say it, if I look at this ellipsoid correctly,
48:31
it'll have a major axis, it'll have a middle axis,
48:37
and it'll have a minor axis. And those three axes will be in the direction
48:44
of the eigenvectors. And the lengths of those axes will be
48:50
determined by the eigenvalues. I can get --
48:56
turn this all into linear algebra, because we have --
49:02
the right thing we know about eigenvectors and eigenvalues, for that matrix is what?
49:08
Of -- let me just tell you that, repeat the main linear algebra point. How could we turn what I said into algebra;
49:18
we would write this A as Q, the eigenvector matrix,
49:25
times lambda, the eigenvalue matrix times Q transposed.
49:30
The principal axis theorem, we'll call it, now. The eigenvectors tell us the directions of the principal
49:37
axes. The eigenvalues tell us the lengths of those axes, actually
49:43
the lengths, or the half-lengths, or one over the eigenvalues, it turns out.
49:48
And that is the matrix factorization which is the most important matrix
49:55
factorization in our eigenvalue material so far.
50:00
That's diagonalization for a symmetric matrix, so instead of the inverse I can write the transposed.
50:09
OK. I've -- so what I've tried today is to tell you the -- what's going on with positive definite matrices.
50:20
Ah, you see all how all these pieces are there and linear algebra connects them.
50:25
OK. See you on Friday.
