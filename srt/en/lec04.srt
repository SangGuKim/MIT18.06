1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,099
Are we ready? Okay, ready for me to start.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,099
Ready for the taping to start in a minute.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,899
He's going to raise his hand and signal when I'm on.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,100
Just a minute, though, let them settle.0 Okay, guys.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,899
Okay, give me the signal, then, when you want me to

6
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,900
start. Okay, this is linear algebra, lecture four. And, the first thing I have to do

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
is something that was on the list for last time, but here it is now. What's the inverse of a product?

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If I multiply two matrices together and I know their inverses, how do I

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,700
get the inverse of A times B? So I know what inverses mean for a single matrix A

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,500
and for a matrix B. What matrix do I multiply by to get the identity if I have A B?

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,500
Okay, that'll be simple but so basic. Then I'm going to use that to --

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I will have a product of matrices and the product that we'll meet will be these elimination matrices

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,700
and the net result of today's lectures is the big formula for elimination,

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,900
so the net result of today's lecture is this great way to look at Gaussian elimination.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We know that we get from A to U by elimination. We know the steps -- but now we get the right way to look

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,699
at it, A equals L U. So that's the high point for today.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,900
Okay. Can I take the easy part, the first step first?

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, suppose A is invertible -- and of course it's going to be

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,699
a big question, when is the matrix invertible? But let's say A is invertible and B is invertible,

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,500
then what matrix gives me the inverse of A B? So that's the direct question.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What's the inverse of A B? Do I multiply those separate inverses?

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,900
Yes. I multiply the two matrices A inverse and B inverse,

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,699
but what order do I multiply? In reverse order. And you see why.

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,300
So the right thing to put here is B inverse A inverse.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,699
That's the inverse I'm after. We can just check that A B times that matrix gives the identity.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay. So why -- once again, it's this fact that I can move

27
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,099
parentheses around. I can just erase them all and do the multiplications any way

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to. So what's the right multiplication to do first? B times B inverse.

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,500
This product here I is the identity. Then A times the identity is the identity

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,500
and then finally A times A inverse gives the identity.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,699
So forgive the dumb example in the book.

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Why do you, do the inverse things in reverse order?

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's just like -- you take off your shoes, you take off your socks, then the good way to invert that

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,699
process is socks back on first, then shoes.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,699
Sorry, okay. I'm sorry that's on the tape.

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And, of course, on the other side we should really just check -- on the other side I have B inverse,

37
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,899
A inverse. That does multiply A B, and this time it's

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
these guys that give the identity, squeeze down, they give the identity, we're in shape.

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,500
Okay. So there's the inverse. Good. While we're at it, let me do a transpose,

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
because the next lecture has got a lot to -- involves transposes. So how do I -- if I transpose a matrix,

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm talking about square, invertible matrices right now. If I transpose one, what's its inverse?

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,699
Well, the nice formula is -- let's see. Let me start from A, A inverse equal the identity.

43
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,699
So -- give me a first row. And let me transpose both sides.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,100
That will bring a transpose into the picture. So if I transpose the identity matrix, what do I have?

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,899
The identity, right? If I exchange rows and columns, the identity

46
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,420
is a symmetric matrix. It doesn't know the difference. If I transpose these guys, that product, then again

47
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,500
it turns out that I have to reverse the order.

48
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,899
I can transpose them separately, but when I multiply, those transposes come in the opposite order.

49
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,699
So it's A inverse transpose times A transpose

50
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
giving the identity. So that's -- this equation is -- just comes directly from that

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
one. But this equation tells me what I wanted to know, namely what is the inverse of this guy A transpose?

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,300
What's the inverse of that -- if I transpose a matrix, what'ss the inverse of the result?

53
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,899
And this equation tells me that here it is. This is the inverse of A transpose.

54
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,300
Inverse of A transpose. Of A transpose.

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,699
So I'll put a big circle around that,

56
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,300
because that's the answer, that's the best answer we could hope for.

57
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,899
That if you want to know the inverse of A transpose

58
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and you know the inverse of A, then you just transpose that. So in a -- to put it another way,

59
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,699
transposing and inversing you can do in either order for a single matrix.

60
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay. So these are like basic facts that we can now use,

61
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,899
all right -- so now I put it to use. I put it to use by thinking -- we're really completing,

62
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,100
the subject of elimination. Actually, -- the thing about elimination is it's the right

63
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
way to understand what the matrix has got. This A equal L U is the most basic factorization

64
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
of a matrix.

65
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,300
I always worry that you will think

66
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,500
this course is all elimination.

67
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,300
It's just row operations. And please don't.

68
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,300
We'll be beyond that, but it's the right algebra to do first.

69
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay. So, now I'm coming near the end of it, but I want to get it in a decent form.

70
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,700
So my decent form is matrix form. I have a matrix A, let's suppose it's a good matrix,

71
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I can do elimination, no row exchanges -- So no row exchanges for now.

72
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,100
Pivots all fine, nothing zero in the pivot position.

73
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,899
I get to the very end, which is U. So I get from A to U.

74
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And I want to know what's the connection? STUDENT: Zero one zero? How is A related to U?

75
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And this is going to tell me that there's a matrix L that connects them.

76
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay. Can I do it for a two by two first? Okay. Two by two, elimination.

77
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,500
Okay, so I'll do it under here. Okay. So let my matrix A be --

78
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We'll keep it simple, say two and an eight, so we know that the first pivot is a two,

79
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and the multiplier's going to be a four and then let me put a one here and what number

80
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
do I not want to put there? Four. I don't want a four there, because in that case,

81
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the second pivot would not -- we wouldn't have a second pivot. The matrix would be singular, general screw-up.

82
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,299
Okay. So let me put some other number here like seven. Okay.

83
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,299
Okay. Now I want to operate on that with my elementary matrix.

84
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,899
So what's the elementary matrix? Strictly speaking, it's E21, because it's

85
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,899
the guy that's going to produce a zero in that position.

86
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,100
And it's going to produce U in one shot,

87
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
because it's just a two by two matrix. So two one and I'm going to take four of those away from those,

88
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
produce that zero and leave a three there. And that's U. And what's the matrix that did it?

89
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,500
Quick review, then. What's the elimination elementary matrix E21 --

90
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,500
it's one zero, thanks. And -- negative four one, right.

91
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,899
Good. Okay. So that -- you see the difference between this

92
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,899
and what I'm shooting for. I'm shooting for A on one side and the other matrices

93
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,500
on the other side of the equation. Okay. So I can do that right away.

94
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Now here's going to be my A equals L U. And you won't have any trouble telling me what --

95
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,700
so A is still two one eight seven.

96
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
L is what you're going to tell me and U is still two one zero three.

97
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,299
Okay. So what's L in this case?

98
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:51,740
Well, first -- so how is L related to this E guy? It's the inverse, because I want to multiply through

99
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
by the inverse of this, which will put the identity here, and the inverse will show up there and I'll call it L.

100
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,500
So what is the inverse of this? Remember those elimination matrices are easy to invert.

101
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,100
The inverse matrix for this one is 1 0 4 1, it's actually flip

102
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
STRANG: Zero one zero. sign. Okay. Do you want -- if we did the numbers right, we must --

103
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
this should be correct. Okay. And of course it is. That says the first row's right, four times the first row

104
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
plus the second row is eight seven. Good. That's simple, two by two. Okay.

105
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,500
But it already shows the form that we're headed for.

106
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It shows -- so what's the L stand for? Why the letter L?

107
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,100
If U stood for upper triangular, then of course L stands for lower triangular.

108
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And actually, it has ones on the diagonal, where this thing has the pivots on the diagonal.

109
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,500
Oh, sometimes we may want to separate out the pivots,

110
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
so can I just mention that sometimes we could also write this as --

111
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
we could have this one zero four one -- I'll just show you how I would divide out this matrix

112
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,100
of pivots -- two three. There's a diagonal matrix.

113
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,299
And I just -- whatever is left is here. Now what's left?

114
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If I divide this first row by two to pull out the two, then I have a one and a one half.

115
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And if I divide the second row by three to pull out the three, then I have a one. Where shall we put them?4 So if this is L U,

116
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,899
this is maybe called L D or pivot U. And now it's a little more balanced,

117
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,500
because we have ones on the diagonal here and here.

118
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,899
And the diagonal matrix in the middle. So both of those...

119
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,899
Matlab would produce either one. I'll basically stay with L U.

120
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,299
Okay. Now I have to think about bigger than two by two.

121
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,500
But right now, this was just like easy exercise. And, to tell the truth, this one was a minus sign

122
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,700
and this one was a plus sign. I mean, that's the only difference.

123
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,899
But, with three by three, there's

124
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,899
a more significant difference. Let me show you how that works.

125
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,500
Let me move up to a three by three, let's say some matrix A, okay?

126
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,899
Let's imagine it's three by three.

127
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I won't write numbers down for now. So what's the first elimination step

128
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
that I do, the first matrix I multiply it by, what letter will I use for

129
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
that? It'll be E two one, because it's -- the first step will be to get a zero in that two one position.

130
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:39,000
right? Okay, now a second row -- say zero zero one and the third guy And then the next step will be to get a zero in the three one

131
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
position. And the final step will be to get a zero in the three two

132
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,100
That's what elimination is, and it produced U. position.

133
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,500
And again, no row exchanges.

134
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm taking the nice case, now, the typical case, too -- when I don't have to do any row exchange,

135
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,860
all I do is these elimination steps. Okay. Now, suppose I want that stuff over on the right-hand side,

136
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
as I really do. That's, like, my point here. I can multiply these together to get a matrix E,

137
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,500
but I want it over on the right. I want its inverse over there. So what's the right expression now?

138
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,100
If I write A and U, what goes there?

139
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So I've got the inverse of this, I've got three matrices in Okay. a row now.

140
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And it's their inverses that are going to show up, because each one is easy to invert.

141
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,899
Question is, what about the whole bunch? How easy is it to invert the whole bunch?

142
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So, that's what we know how to do. We know how to invert, we should take the separate inverses,

143
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
but they go in the opposite order. So what goes here? E three two inverse, right, because I'll

144
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,299
multiply from the left by E three two inverse, then I'll pop it up next to U.

145
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,900
And then will come E three one inverse. And then this'll be the only guy left

146
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,500
standing and that's gone when Ido an E two one inverse. So there is L.

147
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,700
That's L U. L is product of inverses.

148
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,900
Now you still can ask why is this guy preferring inverses?

149
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,900
And let me explain why. Let me explain why is this product nicer than this one?

150
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,500
This product turns out to be better than this one.

151
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,700
Let me take a typical case here. Let me take a typical case.

152
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So let me -- I have to do three by three for you to see the improvement.

153
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Two by two, it was just one E, no problem. But let me go up to this case.

154
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,700
Suppose my matrices E21 -- suppose E21 has a minus two in there.

155
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:50,779
Suppose that -- and now suppose -- oh, I'll even suppose E31 is the identity. I'm going to make the point with just a couple of these. Okay. Now this guy will have -- do something --

156
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,099
now let's suppose minus five one. Okay. There's typical.

157
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,900
That's a typical case in which we didn't need an E31.

158
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,299
Maybe we already had a zero in that three one position. Okay.

159
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,099
Let me see -- is that going to be enough to, show my point?

160
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,900
Let me do that multiplication. So if I do that multiplication it's like good practice to

161
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,500
Okay. multiply these matrices. Tell me what's above the diagonal when I do this multiplication?

162
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
All zeroes. When I do this multiplication, I'm going to get ones on the diagonal and zeroes above.

163
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,500
Because -- what does that say? That says that I'm subtracting rows from lower rows.

164
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So nothing is moving upwards as it did last time in Gauss-Jordan.

165
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,900
Okay. Now -- so really, what I have to do is check this minus two one

166
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,700
zero, now this is -- what's that number? This is the number that I'm really have in mind.

167
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,099
That number is ten. And this one is --

168
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
what goes here? Row three against column two, it looks like the minus five.

169
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's that ten.

170
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
How did that ten get in there? I don't like that ten. I mean -- of course, I don't want to erase it,

171
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:43,000
because it's right. But I don't want it there. It's because -- the ten got in there because I subtracted two

172
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,700
of row one from row two, and then I subtracted five of that

173
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,099
new row two from row three. So doing it in that order, how did row one effect row three?

174
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, it did, because two of it got removed from row two and then five of those got removed from row three.

175
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,900
So altogether ten of row one got thrown into row three.

176
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:19,299
Now my point is in the reverse direction -- so now I can do it -- below it I'll do the inverses.

177
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,500
Okay. And, of course, opposite order. Reverse order. Reverse order.

178
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Okay. So now this is going to -- this is the E that goes on the left

179
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,500
side. Left of A. Now I'm going to do the inverses in the opposite order,

180
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
so what's the -- So the opposite order means I put this inverse first.

181
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And what is its inverse? What's the inverse of E21? Same thing with a plus sign, right?

182
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:06,000
For the individual matrices, instead of taking away two I add back two of row one to row two, so no problem.

183
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,500
And now, in reverse order, I want to invert that.

184
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,900
Just right? I'm doing just this, this. So now the inverse is again the same thing,

185
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,500
but add in the five.

186
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,299
And now I'll do that multiplication and I'll get a happy result.

187
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,900
I hope. Did I do it right so far? Yes, okay.

188
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Let me do the multiplication. I believe this comes out. So row one of the answer is one zero zero.

189
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, I know that all this is going to be left, right? Then I have two one zero.

190
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,700
So I get two one zero there, right? And what's the third row?

191
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,299
What's the third row in this product?

192
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,099
Just read it out to me, the third row?

193
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,299
And this is my matrix L. And it's the one that goes on the left of U.

194
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,099
It goes into -- what do I mean here?

195
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Maybe rather than saying left of A, left of U, let me right down again what I mean.

196
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,099
E A is U, whereas A is L U.

197
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,099
Okay. Let me make the point now in words.

198
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,500
The order that the matrices come for L is the right order. The two and the five don't sort of

199
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,700
interfere to produce this ten one zero zero.

200
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,299
in the right order, the multipliers just sit in the matrix L.

201
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,900
That's the point -- that if I want to know L,

202
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,900
I have no work to do. I just keep a record of what those multipliers were,

203
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,099
and that gives me L. So I'll draw the -- let me say it.

204
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,900
So this is the A=L U. So if no row exchanges, the multipliers that those numbers

205
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
that we multiplied rows by and subtracted, when we did an elimination step --

206
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,900
the multipliers go directly into L.

207
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,700
Okay. So L is -- this is the way, to look at elimination.

208
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,099
You go through the elimination steps, and actually if you do it right, you

209
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,099
can throw away A as you create L U.

210
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,700
If you think about it, those steps of elimination, as when you've finished with row two of A,

211
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
you've created a new row two of U, which you have to save,

212
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
and you've created the multipliers that you used -- So that is like a cycle. which you have to save,

213
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,500
and then you can forget A. So because it's all there in L and U.

214
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,500
So that's -- this moment is maybe the new insight

215
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,299
in elimination that comes from matrix --

216
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,500
doing it in matrix form. So it was -- the product of Es is --

217
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:50,000
we can't see what that product of Es is. The matrix E is not a particularly attractive one.

218
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What's great is when we put them on the other side -- their inverses in the opposite order,

219
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,900
there the L comes out just right. Now -- oh gosh, so today's a sort of,

220
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,299
Okay. like, practical day. Can we think together how expensive is elimination?

221
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:22,900
How many operations do we do? So this is now a kind of new topic which I didn't list as --

222
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,299
on the program, but here it came.

223
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,500
How many operations on an n by n matrix A.

224
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,299
I mean, it's a very practical question.

225
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,900
Can we solve systems of order a thousand, in a second

226
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,500
or a minute or a week? Can we solve systems of order a million in a second or an hour

227
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,500
or a week? I mean, what's the -- if it's n by n, we often want to take n bigger.

228
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I mean, we've put in more information. We make the whole thing is more accurate for the bigger matrix.

229
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:36,000
But it's more expensive, too, and the question is how much more expensive? If I have matrices of order a hundred.

230
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Let's say a hundred by a hundred. Let me take n to be a hundred.

231
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,900
Say n equal a hundred. How many steps are we doing?

232
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,500
How many operations are we actually doing that we --

233
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And let's suppose there aren't any zeroes, because of course if a matrix has got a lot of zeroes in good places,

234
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
we don't have to do those operations, and, it'll be much faster. It's going to move -- it's going to change all rows, But -- so just think for a moment about the first step.

235
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,099
So here's our matrix A, hundred by a hundred.

236
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,299
And the first step will be --

237
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,500
that column, is got zeroes down here. So it's down to 99 by 99, right?

238
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
That's really like the first stage of elimination, That puts row two moves up to row one,

239
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
row three moves up to to get from this hundred by hundred non-zero matrix to this stage

240
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,700
where the first pivot is sitting up here and the first row's okay the first column is okay.

241
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So, eventually -- how many steps did that take? You see, I'm trying to get an idea.

242
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,299
Is the answer proportional to n? Is the total number of steps in elimination, the total number,

243
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
is it proportional to n -- in which case if I double n from a hundred to two hundred -- does it take me twice as long?

244
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Does it square, so it would take me four times as long? Does it cube so it would take me eight times as long?

245
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Or is it n factorial, so it would take me a hundred times as long?

246
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I think, you know, from a practical point of view, we have to have some idea of the cost, here.

247
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So these are the questions that I'm -- let me ask those questions again. Is it proportional -- does it go like N, like N squared,

248
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,740
like N cubed -- or some higher power of N? Like N factorial where every step up multiplies by a hundred

249
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
and then by a hundred and one and then by a hundred and two -- which is it?

250
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Okay, so that's the only way I know to answer that is to think through what we actually

251
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,500
had to do. Okay. So what was the cost here?

252
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,099
Well, let's see. What do I mean by an operation? I guess I mean, well an addition or --

253
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,000
yeah. No big deal. I guess I mean an addition or a subtraction or a multiplication or a division.

254
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,500
Okay. And actually, what operation I doing all the time?

255
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,500
When I multiply row one by multiplier L and I

256
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,700
subtract from row six. What's happening there individually?

257
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
What's going on? If I multiply -- I do a multiplication by L and then a subtraction.

258
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,900
So I guess operation -- Can I count that for the moment as, like, one operation?

259
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,900
Or you may want to count them separately. The typical operation is multiply plus a subtract.

260
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,299
So if I count those together, my answer's going to come out

261
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
What's that? half as many as if -- I mean, if I count them separately, I'd have a certain number of multiplies,

262
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
certain number of subtracts. That's really want to do. How many have I got here? Okay. So, I think -- let's see.

263
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,700
32:44 It's about -- well, how many, roughly?

264
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
How many operations to get from here to here? Well, maybe one way to look at it

265
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
is all these numbers had to get changed. The first row didn't get changed,

266
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
but all the other rows got changed at this step. So this step -- well, I guess maybe --

267
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,099
shall I say it cost about a hundred squared.

268
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,099
I mean, if I had changed the first row,

269
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:30,000
then it would have been exactly hundred squared, because -- because that's how many numbers are here.

270
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:39,000
A hundred squared numbers is the total count of the entry, and all but this insignificant first row got changed.

271
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So I would say about a hundred squared. Okay. Now, what about the next step?

272
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,299
So now the first row is fine.

273
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,700
The second row is fine. And I'm changing these zeroes are all fine,

274
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,900
so what's up with the second step? And then you're with me. Roughly, what's the cost?

275
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,099
If this first step cost a hundred squared, about, operations then this one, which

276
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,300
is really working on this guy to produce this, costs about what?

277
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,500
How many operations to fix?

278
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,500
About ninety-nine squared, or ninety-nine times ninety-eight. But less, right?

279
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,099
Less, because our problem's getting smaller. About ninety-nine squared.

280
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And then I go down and down and the next one will be ninety-eight squared, the next ninety-seven squared and finally I'm down around one squared or --

281
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,300
where it's just like the little numbers. The big numbers are here.

282
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,900
So the number of operations is about n squared plus that

283
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,699
was n, right? n was a hundred? n squared for the first step, then n minus one squared,

284
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
then n minus two squared, finally down to three squared and two squared and even one squared.

285
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:24,940
35:18 No way I should have written that -- squeezed that in. Let me try it so the count is N squared plus N minus one

286
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,500
squared plus -- all the way down to one squared.

287
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,699
That's a pretty decent count. Admittedly, we didn't catch every single tiny operation,

288
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,699
but we got the right leading term here.

289
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,300
And what do those add up to? Okay, so now we're coming to the punch of this,

290
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,500
question, this operation count. So the operations on the left side, on the matrix A

291
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,500
to finally get to U.

292
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,900
And anybody -- so which of these quantities is the right

293
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,900
ballpark for that count? If I add a hundred squared to ninety nine squared to ninety

294
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,900
eight squared -- ninety seven squared, all the way down to two squared then one squared,

295
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,500
what have I got, about? It's just one of these -- let's identify it first.

296
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,099
Is it N? Certainly not. Is it n factorial?

297
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,500
No. If it was n factorial, we would -- with determinants, it is n factorial.

298
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,900
I'll put in a bad mark against determinants, because that --

299
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,699
okay, so what is it? It's n -- well, this is the answer.

300
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,699
It's this order -- n cubed. It's like I have n terms, right?

301
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I've got n terms in this sum. And the biggest one is N squared. So the worst it could be would be n cubed,

302
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,300
but it's not as bad as -- it's N cubed times --

303
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,300
it's about one third of n cubed.

304
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,500
That's the magic operation count.

305
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,500
Somehow that one third takes account of the fact that the numbers are getting smaller.

306
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
If they weren't getting smaller, we would have n terms times n squared, but it would be exactly n cubed.

307
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But our numbers are getting smaller -- actually, row two and row one moves down to row three.

308
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
do you remember where does one third come in this -- I'll even allow a mention of calculus.

309
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:23,000
So calculus can be mentioned, integration can be mentioned now in the next minute and not again for weeks.

310
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,500
It's not that I don't like 18.01, but18.06 is better.

311
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,300
Okay. So, -- so what's -- what's the calculus formula that looks

312
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,300
like? It looks like -- if we were in calculus instead of summing stuff, we would integrate.

313
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,699
So I would integrate x squared and I would get one third x

314
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,300
cubed. So if that was like an integral from one to N,

315
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:09,000
of x squared b x, if the answer would be one third n cubed -- and it's correct for the sum also, because that's, like,

316
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:18,000
the whole point of calculus. The whole point of calculus is -- oh, I don't want to tell you the whole -- I mean, you know the whole point of calculus.

317
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,300
Calculus is like sums except it's continuous.

318
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Okay. And algebra is discreet. Okay. So the answer is one third n cubed.

319
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Now I'll just -- let me say one more thing about operations. What about the right-hand side?

320
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,699
This was what it cost on the left side. This is on A.

321
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,699
Because this is A that we're working with. But what's the cost on the extra column vector b

322
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,300
that we're hanging around here? So b costs a lot less, obviously,

323
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,300
because it's just one column. We carry it through elimination and then

324
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,900
actually we do back substitution. Let me just tell you the answer there. It's n squared.

325
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So the cost for every right hand side is n squared. So let me --

326
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,500
I'll just fit that in here -- for the the cost of b turns out

327
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,699
to be n squared. So you see if we have, as we often

328
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,099
have, a a matrix A and several right-hand sides,

329
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,500
then we pay the price on A, the higher price on A to get it

330
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:58,000
split up into L and U to do elimination on A, but then we can process every right-hand side at low cost.

331
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,900
Okay. So the -- We really have discussed the most fundamental

332
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,900
algorithm for a system of equations.

333
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,699
Okay. So, I'm ready to allow row exchanges.

334
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'm ready to allow -- now what happens to this whole -- today's lecture if there are row exchanges?

335
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,900
When would there be row exchanges?

336
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:48,000
There are row -- we need to do row exchanges if a zero shows up in the pivot position. So moving then into the final section of this chapter,

337
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,699
which is about transposes -- well, we've already seen some transposes, and --

338
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,099
the title of this section is, So tell -- there is another one here.

339
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,099
"Transposes and Permutations." Okay.

340
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,900
So can I say, now, where does a permutation come in?

341
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,699
Let me talk a little about permutations. So that'll be up here, permutations.

342
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,300
So these are the matrices that I need to do row exchanges.

343
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And I may have to do two row exchanges. Can you invent a matrix where I would

344
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,300
have to do two row exchanges and then would come out fine?

345
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,099
Yeah let's just, for the heck of it -- so I'll put it here.

346
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,699
Let me do three by threes. Actually, why don't I just plain list

347
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
all the three by three permutation matrices. There're a nice little group of them.

348
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,900
What are all the matrices that exchange no rows at all?

349
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,500
Well, I'll include the identity.

350
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,980
So that's a permutation matrix that doesn't do anything. Now what's the permutation matrix that exchanges --

351
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,300
what is P12? The permutation matrix that exchanges rows one and two

352
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,300
would be -- 0 1 0 --

353
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,900
1 0 0, right. I just exchanged those rows of the identity and I've got it.

354
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,900
Okay. Actually, I'll -- yes. Let me clutter this up. Okay.

355
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,900
Give me a complete list of all the row exchange matrices.

356
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,699
So what are they? They're all the ways I can take the identity matrix and rearrange its rows.

357
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,300
How many will there be? How many three by three permutation matrices?

358
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,900
Shall we keep going and get the answer? So tell me some more. What one are you going to do now?

359
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I'm going to switch rows one and -- One and three, okay. One and three, leaving two alone. Now what else? Okay. Switch -- what would be the next easy one -- is switch two and three, good. So I'll leave one zero zero alone and I'll switch --

360
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,099
I'll move number three up and number two down.

361
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Okay. Those are the ones that just exchange single -- a pair of rows.

362
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
This guy, this guy and this guy exchanges a pair of rows, but now there are more possibilities.

363
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,099
What's left? And there's one more, which is --

364
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,900
let's see. What's left? I'm lost.

365
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,900
STUDENT: Is it zero zero one?

366
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,900
STRANG: Okay. STUDENT: One zero zero. STRANG: One zero zero, okay.

367
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,500
Zero one zero. Okay. Great.

368
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,699
Six. Six of them. Six P. And they're sort of nice, because what

369
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,099
happens if I write, multiply two of them together?

370
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,699
If I multiply two of these matrices together,

371
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,699
what can you tell me about the answer?

372
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,699
It's on the list. If I do some row exchanges and then I

373
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,699
do some more row exchanges, then all together

374
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,699
I've done row exchanges. So if I multiply -- but, I don't know.

375
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And if I invert, then I'm just doing row exchanges to get back again.

376
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So the inverses are all there. It's a little family of matrices that --

377
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,699
they've got their own -- if I multiply,

378
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm still inside this group. If I invert I'm inside this group -- actually, group is the right name for this subject.

379
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,900
It's a group of six matrices, and what about the inverses?

380
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
What's the inverse of this guy, for example? What's the inverse -- if I exchange rows one and two,

381
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,699
what's the inverse matrix? Just tell me fast.

382
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:39,500
The inverse of that matrix is -- if I exchange rows one and two, then

383
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
what I should do to get back to where I started is the same thing.

384
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,300
So this thing is its own inverse. That's probably its own inverse.

385
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:00,000
This is probably not -- actually, I think these are inverses of each other. Oh, yeah, actually --

386
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,300
the inverse is the transpose. There's a curious fact about permutations matrices,

387
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:15,300
that the inverses are the transposes. And final moment -- how many are there if I --

388
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
how many four by four permutations? So let me take four by four --

389
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,500
how many Ps? Well, okay.

390
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,500
Make a good guess. Twenty four, right. Twenty four Ps.

391
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
48:44 Okay.

392
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,900
So, we've got these permutation matrices,

393
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,199
and in the next lecture, we'll use them.
