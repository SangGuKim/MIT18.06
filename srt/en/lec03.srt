1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I've been multiplying matrices already,

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,800
but certainly time for me to discuss the rules for matrix multiplication.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,800
And the interesting part is the many ways you can do it,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,199
and they all give the same answer. And they're all important. So matrix multiplication, and then, come inverses.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,799
So we mentioned the inverse of a matrix. That's a big deal.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Lots to do about inverses and how to find them. Okay, so I'll begin with how to multiply two matrices.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,399
First way, okay, so suppose I have a matrix A multiplying

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
a matrix B and -- giving me a result --

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
well, I could call it C. A times B. Okay.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So, let me just review the rule for this entry.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's the entry in row i and column j. So that's the i j entry.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Right there is C i j. We always write the row number and then the column number.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So I might -- I might -- maybe I take it C 3 4, just to make it specific.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So instead of i j, let me use numbers. C 3 4. So where does that come from, the three four entry?

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,400
It comes from row three, here, row three and column four,

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
as you know. Column four. And can I just write down, or can we write down the formula for it?

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If we look at the whole row and the whole column, the quick way for me to say it is row three of A --

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,599
I could use a dot for dot product. I won't often use that, actually. Dot column four of B.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,599
But this gives us a chance to just, like, use a little matrix notation.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,400
What are the entries? What's this first entry in row three?

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,800
That number that's sitting right there is... A, so it's got two indices and what are they?

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
3 1. So there's an a 3 1 there. Now what's the first guy at the top of column four?

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,599
So what's sitting up there? B 1 4, right.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,599
So that this dot product starts with A 3 1 times B 1 4.

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,599
And then what's the next -- so this is like I'm accumulating this sum, then comes the next guy, A 3 2, second column,

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,199
times B 2 4, second row. So it's b A 3 2, B 2 4 and so on.

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,199
Just practice with indices. Oh, let me even practice with a summation formula.

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,800
So this is -- most of the course, I use whole vectors.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,199
I very seldom, get down to the details of these particular entries, but here we'd better do it.

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,199
So it's some kind of a sum, right? Of things in row three, column K shall I say?

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Times things in row K, column four.

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you see that that's what we're seeing here? This is K is one, here K is two, on along --

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,199
so the sum goes all the way along the row and down the column, say, one to N.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,600
So that's what the C three four entry looks like. A sum of a three K b K four.

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,800
Just takes a little practice to do that. Okay. And -- well, maybe I should say --

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
when are we allowed to multiply these matrices? What are the shapes of these things?

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,600
The shapes are -- if we allow them to be not necessarily square matrices.

38
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If they're square, they've got to be the same size. If they're rectangular, they're not the same size.

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,800
If they're rectangular, this might be -- well, I always think of A as m by n.

40
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
m rows, n columns. So that sum goes to n.

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,199
Now what's the point -- how many rows does B have to have?

42
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
n. The number of rows in B, the number of guys that we meet coming down has to match the number of ones

43
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
across. So B will have to be n by something.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Whatever. P. So the number of columns here has to match the number of rows

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
there, and then what's the result? What's the shape of the result? What's the shape of C, the output?

46
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,800
Well, it's got these same m rows -- it's got m rows.

47
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,600
And how many columns? P. m by P. Okay.

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,800
So there are m times P little numbers in there, entries, and each one, looks like that.

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,600
Okay. So that's the standard rule. That's the way people think of multiplying matrices.

50
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
I do it too.

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,600
But I want to talk about other ways to look at that same calculation,

52
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
looking at whole columns and whole rows.

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay. So can I do A B C again? A B equaling C again?

54
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But now, tell me about...

55
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,600
I'll put it up here. So here goes A, again, times B producing C.

56
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,600
And again, this is m by n. This is n by P and this is m by P. Okay.

57
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now I want to look at whole columns. I want to look at the columns of --

58
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,800
here's the second way to multiply matrices. Because I'm going to build on what I know already.

59
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,600
How do I multiply a matrix by a column? I know how to multiply this matrix by that column.

60
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,399
Shall I call that column one?

61
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,199
That tells me column one of the answer.

62
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,399
The matrix times the first column is that first column. Because none of this stuff entered

63
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
that part of the answer. The matrix times the second column is the second column of the answer.

64
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,600
Do you see what I'm saying? That I could think of multiplying a matrix

65
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,800
by a vector, which I already knew how to do, and I can think of just P columns sitting side by side,

66
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,399
just like resting next to each other. And I multiply A times each one of those.

67
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And I get the P columns of the answer. Do you see this as -- this is quite nice,

68
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,600
to be able to think, okay, matrix multiplication works

69
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
so that I can just think of having several columns, multiplying by A and getting the columns of the answer.

70
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,399
So, like, here's column one shall I call that column one?

71
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And what's going in there is A times column one.

72
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay. So that's the picture a column at a time. So what does that tell me?

73
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
What does that tell me about these columns? These columns of C are combinations,

74
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,600
because we've seen that before, of columns of A.

75
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,799
Every one of these comes from A times this, and A times a vector is a combination

76
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,799
of the columns of A. And it makes sense, because the columns of A have length m

77
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,399
and the columns of C have length m. And every column of C is some combination

78
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
of the columns of A. And it's these numbers in here that tell me what combination it is.

79
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,200
Do you see that? That in that answer, C, I'm seeing stuff that's

80
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
combinations of these columns. Now, suppose I look at it -- that's two ways now.

81
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,399
The third way is look at it by rows. So now let me change to rows.

82
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,799
Okay. So now I can think of a row of A --

83
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,200
a row of A multiplying all these rows here and producing a row

84
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,799
of the product. So this row takes a combination of these rows

85
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,200
and that's the answer. So these rows of C are combinations of what?

86
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Tell me how to finish that. The rows of C, when I have a matrix B, it's got its rows

87
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and I multiply by A, and what does that do? It mixes the rows up.

88
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,600
It creates combinations of the rows of B, thanks.

89
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,200
Rows of B. That's what I wanted to see, that this answer --

90
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I can see where the pieces are coming from. The rows in the answer are coming as combinations of these

91
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,799
rows. The columns in the answer are coming as combinations of those

92
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
columns. And so that's three ways. Now you can say, okay, what's the fourth way?

93
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,600
The fourth way -- so that's -- now we've got, like, the regular way,

94
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,200
the column way, the row way and --

95
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,200
what's left? The one that I can --

96
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,799
well, one way is columns times rows.

97
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,399
What happens if I multiply -- So this was row times column, it gave a number.

98
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,200
Okay. Now I want to ask you about column times row. If I multiply a column of A times a row of B,

99
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
what shape I ending up with? So if I take a column times a row,

100
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that's definitely different from taking a row times a column. So a column of A was -- what's the shape of a column of A?

101
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
m by one. A column of A is a column.

102
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's got m entries and one column. And what's a row of B?

103
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,799
It's got one row and P columns.

104
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So what's the shape -- what do I get if I multiply a column by a row?

105
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,600
I get a big matrix. I get a full-sized matrix. If I multiply a column by a row --

106
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,200
should we just do one? Let me take the column two three four times the row one six.

107
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
That product there --

108
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I mean, when I'm just following the rules of matrix multiplication, those rules are just looking like --

109
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
kind of petite, kind of small, because the rows here

110
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
are so short and the columns there are so short, but they're the same length, one entry.

111
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,799
So what's the answer? What's the answer if I do two three four times one six, just

112
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
for practice? Well, what's the first row of the answer?

113
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,799
Two twelve. And the second row of the answer is three eighteen.

114
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,399
And the third row of the answer is four twenty four.

115
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
That's a very special matrix, there.

116
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,399
Very special matrix. What can you tell me about its columns, the columns of that matrix?

117
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,399
They're multiples of this guy, right? They're multiples of that one.

118
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Which follows our rule. We said that the columns of the answer were combinations, but there's only -- to take a combination of one guy,

119
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
it's just a multiple. The rows of the answer, what can you tell me about those three rows?

120
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,399
They're all multiples of this row.

121
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They're all multiples of one six, as we expected. But I'm getting a full-sized matrix.

122
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,399
And now, just to complete this thought, if I have --

123
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,799
let me write down the fourth way.

124
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,200
A B is a sum of columns of A times rows of B.

125
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,399
So that, for example, if my matrix was two three four

126
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
and then had another column, say, seven eight nine,

127
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,200
and my matrix here has -- say, started with one six and then

128
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,200
had another column like zero zero, then --

129
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
here's the fourth way, okay? I've got two columns there, I've got two rows there.

130
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,600
So the beautiful rule is -- see, the whole thing by columns and rows

131
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,799
is that I can take the first column times the first row

132
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,600
and add the second column times the second row.

133
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,200
So that's the fourth way -- that I can take columns times rows,

134
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
first column times first row, second column times second row and add. Actually, what will I get?

135
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,600
What will the answer be for that matrix multiplication?

136
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, this one it's just going to give us zero, so in fact I'm back to this -- that's the answer,

137
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,600
for that matrix multiplication. I'm happy to put up here these facts about matrix

138
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,599
multiplication, because it gives me a chance to write down special matrices like this.

139
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,200
This is a special matrix. All those rows lie on the same line.

140
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
All those rows lie on the line through one six. If I draw a picture of all these row vectors,

141
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
they're all the same direction. If I draw a picture of these two column vectors,

142
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,400
they're in the same direction. Later, I would use this language.

143
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Not too much later, either. I would say the row space, which is like all the combinations of the rows,

144
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
is just a line for this matrix. The row space is the line through the vector one six.

145
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
All the rows lie on that line. And the column space is also a line.

146
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
All the columns lie on the line through the vector two three four.

147
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,599
So this is like a really minimal matrix. And it's because of these ones.

148
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Okay. So that's a third way.

149
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,400
Now I want to say one more thing about matrix multiplication while we're on the subject.

150
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,400
And it's this. You could also multiply -- You could also cut the matrix into blocks

151
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,799
and do the multiplication by blocks. Yet that's actually so, useful that I want to mention it.

152
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,400
Block multiplication. So I could take my matrix A and I could chop it up, like,

153
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
maybe just for simplicity, let me chop it into two -- into four square blocks.

154
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,799
Suppose it's square. Let's just take a nice case. And B, suppose it's square also, same size.

155
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,599
So these sizes don't have to be the same.

156
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What they have to do is match properly. Here they certainly will match.

157
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So here's the rule for block multiplication, that if this has blocks like, A --

158
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
so maybe A1, A2, A3, A4 are the blocks here,

159
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and these blocks are B1, B2,3 and B4? Then the answer I can find block.

160
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And if you tell me what's in that block, then I'm going to be quiet about matrix multiplication for the rest of the day.

161
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What goes into that block? You see, these might be -- this matrix might be --

162
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
these matrices might be, like, twenty by twenty with blocks that are ten by ten, to take the easy case where all the blocks

163
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
are the same shape. And the point is that I could multiply those by blocks.

164
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,400
And what goes in here? What's that block in the answer?

165
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
A1 B1, that's a matrix times a matrix, it's the right size, ten by ten.

166
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
Any more? Plus, what else goes in there?

167
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,400
A2 B3, right? It's just like block rows times block columns.

168
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,799
Nobody, I think, not even Gauss could see instantly that it works.

169
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But somehow, if we check it through, all five ways we're doing the same multiplications.

170
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,200
So this familiar multiplication is what we're really doing when we do it

171
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,400
by columns, by rows by columns times rows and by blocks.

172
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,200
Okay. I just have to, like, get the rules straight for matrix multiplication.

173
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,500
Okay.

174
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,799
All right, I'm ready for the second topic, which is inverses. Okay.

175
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,500
Ready for inverses.

176
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,599
And let me do it for square matrices first.

177
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,200
Okay. So I've got a square matrix A.

178
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And it may or may not have an inverse, right? Not all matrices have inverses. In fact, that's the most important question you can ask

179
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,799
about the matrix, is if it's -- if you know it's square, is it invertible or not?

180
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,400
If it is invertible, then there is some other matrix, shall I call it A inverse?

181
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,599
And what's the -- if A inverse exists --

182
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,799
there's a big "if" here. If this matrix exists, and it'll be really central to figure out

183
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
when does it exist? And then if it does exist, how would you find it?

184
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,599
But what's the equation here that I haven't --

185
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
that I have to finish now? This matrix, if it exists multiplies A and produces,

186
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,599
I think, the identity.

187
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,799
But a real -- an inverse for a square matrix could be on the right as well

188
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,200
-- this is true, too, that it's --

189
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
if I have a -- yeah in fact, this is not -- this is probably the --

190
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,400
this is something that's not easy to prove, but it works.

191
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That a left -- square matrices, a left inverse is also a right

192
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,599
inverse. If I can find a matrix on the left that gets the identity,

193
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,599
then also that matrix on the right will produce that identity. For rectangular matrices, we'll see a left inverse

194
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
that isn't a right inverse. In fact, the shapes wouldn't allow it. But for square matrices, the shapes

195
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
allow it and it happens, if A has an inverse.

196
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,200
Okay, so give me some cases -- let's see. I hate to be negative here, but let's talk

197
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,400
about the case with no inverse. So -- these matrices are called invertible or non-singular --

198
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:44,000
those are the good ones. And we want to be able to identify how -- if we're given a matrix, has it got an inverse?

199
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,799
Can I talk about the singular case?

200
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,500
No inverse.

201
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,200
All right. Best to start with an example.

202
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Tell me an example -- let's get an example up here. Let's make it two by two --

203
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,200
of a matrix that has not got an inverse. And let's see why.

204
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Let me write one up. No inverse. Let's see why.

205
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,599
Let me write up -- one three two six.

206
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,799
Why does that matrix have no inverse?

207
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,400
You could answer that various ways.

208
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,599
Give me one reason.

209
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,599
Well, you could -- if you know about determinants, which you're not supposed to, you could take its determinant

210
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,799
and you would get -- Zero. Okay.

211
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Now -- all right. Let me ask you other reasons.

212
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,400
I mean, as for other reasons that that matrix isn't invertible.

213
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,200
Here, I could use what I'm saying here.

214
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,200
Suppose A times other matrix gave the identity.

215
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Why is that not possible? Because -- oh, yeah --

216
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm thinking about columns here. If I multiply this matrix A by some other matrix, then the --

217
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,200
the result -- what can you tell me about the columns? They're all multiples of those columns, right?

218
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,200
If I multiply A by another matrix that -- the product has columns that come from those columns.

219
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So can I get the identity matrix? No way. The columns of the identity matrix, like one zero --

220
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
it's not a combination of those columns, because those two columns lie on the -- both lie on the same line.

221
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Every combination is just going to be on that line and I can't get one zero.

222
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,799
So, do you see that sort of column picture of the matrix

223
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
not being invertible. In fact, here's another reason. This is even a more important reason.

224
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Well, how can I say more important? All those are important. This is another way to see it.

225
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,599
A matrix has no inverse -- yeah -- here -- now this is important.

226
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,400
A matrix has no -- a square matrix won't have an inverse if there's no inverse because I can solve --

227
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,599
I can find an X of -- a vector X with A times --

228
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,400
this A times X giving zero.

229
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,200
This is the reason I like best. That matrix won't have an inverse.

230
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Can you -- well, let me change I to U.

231
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,799
So tell me a vector X that, solves A X equals zero.

232
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I mean, this is, like, the key equation. In mathematics, all the key equations have zero on the right-hand side.

233
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:01,000
So what's the X? Tell me an X here -- so now I'm going to put -- slip in the X that you tell me

234
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,799
and I'm going to get zero. What X would do that job?

235
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Three and negative one? Is that the one you picked, or -- yeah. Or another -- well, if you picked zero with zero,

236
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm not so excited, right? Because that would always work. So it's really the fact that this vector

237
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
isn't zero that's important. It's a non-zero vector and three negative one would do it.

238
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
That just says three of this column minus one of that column is the zero column.

239
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Okay. So now I know that A couldn't be invertible.

240
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But what's the reasoning? If A X is zero, suppose I multiplied by A inverse.

241
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,400
Yeah, well here's the reason. Here -- this is why this spells disaster for an inverse.

242
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,799
The matrix can't have an inverse if some combination of the columns gives z- it gives nothing.

243
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,599
Because, I could take A X equals zero, I could multiply by A inverse and what would I discover?

244
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Suppose I take that equation and I multiply by -- if A inverse existed, which of course I'm going to come

245
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
to the conclusion it can't because if it existed, if there was an A inverse to this dopey matrix,

246
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I would multiply that equation by that inverse and I would discover X is zero.

247
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
If I multiply A by A inverse on the left, I get X. If I multiply by A inverse on the right, I get zero.

248
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So I would discover X was zero. But it -- X is not zero. X -- this guy wasn't zero.

249
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,599
There it is. It's three minus one. So, conclusion -- only, it takes us some time to really work

250
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,400
with that conclusion -- our conclusion will be that non-invertible matrices,

251
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,799
singular matrices, some combinations of their columns

252
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,799
gives the zero column. They they take some vector X into zero.

253
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,599
And there's no way A inverse can recover, right? That's what this equation says.

254
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,599
This equation says I take this vector X and multiplying by A gives zero.

255
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But then when I multiply by A inverse, I can never escape from zero.

256
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,599
So there couldn't be an A inverse. Where here -- okay, now fix --

257
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,599
all right. Now let me take -- all right, back to the positive side.

258
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,599
Let's take a matrix that does have an inverse. And why not invert it?

259
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Okay. Can I -- so let me take on this third board a matrix -- shall I fix that up a little?

260
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,599
Tell me a matrix that has got an inverse.

261
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,200
Well, let me say one three two -- what shall I put there?

262
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,599
Well, don't put six, I guess is -- right?

263
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Do I any favorites here?

264
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,500
One? Or eight?

265
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,400
I don't care. What, seven? Seven. Okay. Seven is a lucky number. All right, seven, okay.

266
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Okay. So -- now what's our idea? We believe that this matrix is invertible. Those who like determinants have quickly taken its determinant

267
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,200
and found it wasn't zero. Those who like columns, and probably that --

268
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
that department is not totally popular yet -- but those who like columns will look at those two columns

269
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,200
and say, hey, they point in different directions. So I can get anything.

270
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Now, let me see, what do I mean? How I going to computer A inverse? So A inverse --

271
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,000
here's A inverse, now, and I have to find it. And what do I get when I do this multiplication?

272
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500
The identity.

273
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You know, forgive me for taking two by two-s, but -- lt's good to keep the computations manageable and let

274
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,400
the ideas come out. Okay, now what's the idea I want?

275
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,400
I'm looking for this matrix A inverse, how I going to find it? Right now, I've got four numbers to find.

276
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,200
I'm going to look at the first column.

277
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,400
Let me take this first column, A B. What's up there?

278
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,800
What -- tell me this. What equation does the first column satisfy?

279
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,400
The first column satisfies A times that column is one zero.

280
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The first column of the answer. And the second column, C D, satisfies A times

281
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,800
that second column is zero one. You see that finding the inverse is like solving two systems.

282
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
One system, when the right-hand side is one zero -- I'm just going to split it into two pieces.

283
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,599
I don't even need to rewrite it. I can take A times -- so let me put it here.

284
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,199
A times column j of A inverse is column j of the identity.

285
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,400
I've got n equations. I've got, well, two in this case.

286
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And they have the same matrix, A, but they have different right-hand sides. The right-hand sides are just the columns

287
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:39,000
of the identity, this guy and this guy. And these are the two solutions. Do you see what I'm going --

288
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,800
I'm looking at that equation by columns.

289
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm looking at A times this column, giving that guy, and A times that column giving that guy. So -- Essentially -- so this is like the Gauss --

290
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
we're back to Gauss. We're back to solving systems of equations, but we're solving --

291
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,199
we've got two right-hand sides instead of one. That's where Jordan comes in.

292
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
So at the very beginning of the lecture, I mentioned Gauss-Jordan, let me write it up again.

293
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Okay. Here's the Gauss-Jordan idea.

294
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,400
Gauss-Jordan solve two equations at once.

295
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,599
Okay. Let me show you how the mechanics go.

296
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,800
How do I solve a single equation?

297
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,599
So the two equations are one three two seven,

298
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,400
multiplying A B gives one zero.

299
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,800
And the other equation is the same one three two seven multiplying C D gives zero one.

300
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Okay. That'll tell me the two columns of the inverse.

301
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I'll have inverse. In other words, if I can solve with this matrix A,

302
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,599
if I can solve with that right-hand side and that right-hand side, I'm invertible.

303
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,599
I've got it. Okay. And Jordan sort of said to Gauss, solve them together,

304
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,000
look at the matrix -- if we just solve this one, I would look at one three two seven,

305
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,199
and how do I deal with the right-hand side? I stick it on as an extra column, right?

306
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
That's this augmented matrix. That's the matrix when I'm watching the right-hand side

307
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:09,000
at the same time, doing the same thing to the right side that I do to the left? So I just carry it along as an extra column.

308
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,599
Now I'm going to carry along two extra columns.

309
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,599
And I'm going to do whatever Gauss wants, right? I'm going to do elimination.

310
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm going to get this to be simple and this thing will turn into the inverse.

311
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
This is what's coming. I'm going to do elimination steps to make this

312
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,199
into the identity, and lo and behold, the inverse will show up here.

313
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,400
K--- let's do it. Okay. So what are the elimination steps?

314
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So you see -- here's my matrix A and here's the identity, like, stuck on, augmented on.

315
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
STUDENT: I'm sorry... STRANG: Yeah? STUDENT: -- is the two and the three supposed to be switched?

316
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,599
STRANG: Did I -- oh, no, they weren't supposed to be switched. Sorry. Thanks.

317
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,800
Okay. Thank you very much. And there -- I've got them right.

318
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,500
Okay, thanks. Okay.

319
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So let's do elimination. All right, it's going to be simple, right? So I take two of this row away from this row.

320
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So this row stays the same and two of those come away from this. That leaves me with a zero and a one and two of these away from

321
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,800
this is that what you're getting -- after one elimination step --

322
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,599
Let me sort of separate the -- the left half from the right half.

323
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,599
So two of that first row got subtracted from the second row. Now this is an upper triangular form.

324
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,400
Gauss would quit, but Jordan says keeps going. Use elimination upwards.

325
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Subtract a multiple of equation two from equation one to get rid of the three.

326
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,400
So let's go the whole way. So now I'm going to -- this guy is fine, but I'm going to --

327
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
what do I do now? What's my final step that produces the inverse?

328
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,400
I multiply this by the right number to get up to ther to remove that three.

329
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So I guess, I -- since this is a one, there's the pivot sitting there. I multiply it by three and subtract from that,

330
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
so what do I get? I'll have one zero -- oh, yeah that was my whole point. I'll multiply this by three and subtract from that,

331
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
which will give me seven. And I multiply this by three and subtract from that,

332
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,400
which gives me a minus three.

333
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And what's my hope, belief?

334
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,800
Here I started with A and the identity, and I ended up with the identity and who?

335
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
That better be A inverse.

336
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,599
That's the Gauss Jordan idea. Start with this long matrix, double-length A I, eliminate,

337
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,000
eliminate until this part is down to I, then this one will -- must be for some reason,

338
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
and we've got to find the reason -- must be A inverse. Shall I just check that it works?

339
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,199
Let me just check that -- can I multiply this matrix this part

340
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,400
times A, I'll carry A over here and just do that

341
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
multiplication. You'll see I'll do it the old fashioned way. Seven minus six is a one.

342
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Twenty one minus twenty one is a zero, minus two plus two is a zero, minus six plus seven is a one.

343
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,400
Check. So that is the inverse.

344
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
That's the Gauss-Jordan idea. So, you'll -- one of the homework problems or more than

345
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,400
one for Wednesday will ask you to go through those steps.

346
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,400
I think you just got to go through Gauss-Jordan a couple of times, but I --

347
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,800
yeah -- just to see the mechanics.

348
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,400
But the, important thing is, why -- is, like, what happened?

349
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,400
Why did we -- why did we get A inverse there? Let me ask you that.

350
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,800
We got -- so we take --

351
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,800
We do row reduction, we do elimination on this long matrix A I until the first half

352
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Then a second half is A inverse. is up. Well, how do I see that?

353
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Let me put up here how I see that. So here's my Gauss-Jordan thing, and I'm doing stuff to it.

354
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,199
So I'm -- well, whole lot of E's.

355
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Remember those are those elimination matrices. Those are the -- those are the things that we figured out last

356
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,800
time. Yes, that's what an elimination step is it's in matrix form,

357
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm multiplying by some Es. And the result -- well, so I'm multiplying by a whole bunch

358
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,599
of Es. So, I get a -- can I call the overall matrix E?

359
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That's the elimination matrix, the product of all those little pieces. What do I mean by little pieces?

360
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Well, there was an elimination matrix that subtracted two of that away from that.

361
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Then there was an elimination matrix that subtracted three of that away from that. I guess in this case, that was all.

362
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
So there were just two Es in this case, one that did this step and one that did this step

363
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,400
and together they gave me an E that does both steps.

364
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And the net result was to get an I here.

365
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And you can tell me what that has to be.

366
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,800
This is, like, the picture of what happened. If E multiplied A, whatever that E is --

367
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,199
we never figured it out in this way.

368
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,199
But whatever that E times that E is, E times A is --

369
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,599
What's E times A?

370
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,199
It's I. That E, whatever the heck it was, multiplied A and produced

371
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,599
So E must be -- E A equaling I tells us what E is, I. namely it is --

372
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
STUDENT: It's the inverse of A. STRANG: It's the inverse of A. Great.

373
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,199
And therefore, when the second half, when E multiplies I, it's E --

374
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,400
Put this A inverse. You see the picture looking that way?

375
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
E times A is the identity. It tells us what E has to be.

376
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,000
It has to be the inverse, and therefore, on the right-hand side, where E -- where we just smartly tucked on the identity,

377
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,800
it's turning in, step by step -- It's turning into A inverse.

378
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,800
There is the statement of Gauss-Jordan elimination.

379
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,599
That's how you find the inverse. Where we can look at it as elimination,

380
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
as solving n equations at the same time -- --

381
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,599
and tacking on n columns, solving those equations and up goes the n columns of A inverse Okay, thanks.

382
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
See you on Wednesday.
