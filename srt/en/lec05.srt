1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay. This is lecture five in linear algebra. And, it will complete this chapter of the book.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So the last section of this chapter

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is two point seven that talks about permutations, which

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
finished the previous lecture, and transposes, which also came in the previous lecture.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There's a little more to do with those guys, permutations and transposes.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But then the heart of the lecture will be the beginning

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
of what you could say is the beginning of linear algebra, the beginning of real linear algebra which is seeing

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
a bigger picture with vector spaces -- not just vectors, but spaces of vectors and sub-spaces of those spaces.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So we're a little ahead of the syllabus, which is good, because we're coming to the place

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
where, there's a lot to do. Okay. So, to begin with permutations.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,599
Can I just -- so these permutations, those are matrices P and they execute

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,500
row exchanges.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And we may need them. We may have a perfectly good matrix, a perfect matrix A that's invertible that we can solve A

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
x=b, but to do it -- I've got to allow myself that extra freedom

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
that if a zero shows up in the pivot position I move it away.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I get a non-zero. I get a proper pivot there by exchanging from a row below.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And you've seen that already, and I just want to collect the ideas together.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And principle, I could even have to do that two times, or more times.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I have to allow -- to complete the -- the theory, the possibility that I take my matrix A,

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I start elimination, I find out that I need row exchanges and I do it and continue and I finish.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay. Then all I want to do is say -- and I won't make a big project

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
out of this -- what happens to A equal L U?

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
So A equal L U --

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
this was a matrix L with ones on the diagonal and zeroes

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
above and multipliers below, and this U we know, with zeroes down here.

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,500
That's only possible.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That description of elimination assumes that we don't have a P, that we don't have any row exchanges.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And now I just want to say, okay, how do I account for row exchanges? Because that doesn't.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The P in this factorization is the identity matrix.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The rows were in a good order, we left them there. Maybe I'll just add a little moment of reality,

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,800
too, about how Matlab actually does elimination.

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Matlab not only checks whether that pivot is not zero, as every human would do.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It checks for is that pivot big enough, because it doesn't like very, very small pivots.

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Pivots close to zero are numerically bad. So actually if we ask Matlab to solve a system,

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it will do some elimination some row exchanges, which we don't think are necessary.

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Algebra doesn't say they're necessary, but accuracy -- numerical accuracy says they are.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, we're doing algebra, so here we will say, well, what do row exchanges do,

38
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
but we won't do them unless we have to. But we may have to.

39
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,399
And then, the result is --

40
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
it's hiding here. It's the main fact.

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is the description of elimination with row exchanges. So A equal L U becomes P A equal L U.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So this P is the matrix that does the row exchanges, and actually it does them --

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
it gets the rows into the right order, into the good order where pivots will not --

44
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,000
where zeroes won't appear in the pivot position, where L and U will come out right as up here.

45
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So, that's the point. Actually, I don't want to labor that point,

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that a permutation matrix -- and you remember what those were.

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll remind you from last time of what the main points about permutation matrices were --

48
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and then just leave this factorization as the general case.

49
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,600
This is -- any invertible A we get this.

50
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
For almost every one, we don't need a P. But there's that handful that do need row exchanges,

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and if we do need them, there they are. Okay, finally, just to remember what P was.

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,800
So permutations, P is the identity matrix

53
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,500
with reordered rows.

54
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I include in reordering the possibility that you just leave them the same. So the identity matrix is -- okay.

55
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,800
That's, like, your basic permutation matrix --

56
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
your do-nothing permutation matrix is the identity. And then there are the ones that exchange two rows and then

57
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the ones that exchange three rows and then then ones that exchange four --

58
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
well, it gets a little -- it gets more interesting algebraically

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
if you've got four rows, you might exchange them all in one big cycle. One to two, two to three, three to four, four to one.

60
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Or you might have -- exchange one and two and three and four.

61
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Lots of possibilities there. In fact, how many possibilities?

62
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,800
The answer was (n)factorial. This is n(n-1)(n-2)...

63
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
(3)(2)(1). That's the number of -- this counts the reorderings,

64
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,800
the possible reorderings. So it counts all the n by n permutations.

65
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And all those matrices have these -- have this nice property that they're all invertible,

66
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
because we can bring those rows back into the normal order.

67
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And the matrix that does that is just P -- is just the same as the transpose.

68
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You might take a permutation matrix, multiply by its transpose and you will see how --

69
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that the ones hit the ones and give the ones in the identity

70
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
matrix. So this is a -- we'll be highly interested in matrices

71
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
that have nice properties. And one property that -- maybe I could rewrite that as P

72
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
transpose P is the identity. That tells me in other words that this

73
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
is the inverse of that. Okay. We'll be interested in matrices that have P transpose

74
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
P equal the identity. There are more of them than just permutations, but my point right now is that permutations are like a little

75
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
group in the middle -- in the center of these special matrices.

76
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay. So now we know how many there are.

77
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Twenty four in the case of -- there are twenty four four by four permutations, there are five factorial which is

78
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
a hundred and twenty, five times twenty four would bump us up to a hundred and twenty -- so listing all the five by five

79
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,799
permutations would be not so much fun.

80
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Okay. So that's permutations.

81
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now also in section two seven is some discussion of transposes.

82
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And can I just complete that discussion. First of all, I haven't even transposed a matrix

83
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
on the board here, have I? So I'd better do it. So suppose I take a matrix like (1 2 4; 3 3 1).

84
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,799
It's a rectangular matrix, three by two.

85
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And I want to transpose it. So what's --

86
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll use a T, also Matlab would use a prime.

87
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And the result will be -- I'll right it here, because this was three rows and two columns,

88
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
this was a three by two matrix. The transpose will be two rows and three columns,

89
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,200
two by three. So it's short and wider.

90
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And, of course, that row -- that column becomes a row --

91
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:36,000
that column becomes the other row. And at the same time, that row became a column.

92
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This row became a column. Oh, what's the general formula for the transpose?

93
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
So the transpose --

94
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
you see it in numbers. What I'm going to write is the same thing in symbols.

95
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The numbers are the clearest, of course. But in symbols, if I take A transpose

96
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and I ask what number is in row I and column J of A transpose?

97
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,399
Well, it came out of A.

98
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It came out A by this flip across the main diagonal.

99
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And, actually, it was the number in A

100
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,799
which was in row J, column I.

101
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So the row and column -- the row and column numbers just get reversed.

102
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The row number becomes the column number, the column number becomes the row number. No problem.

103
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay. Now, a special -- the best matrices, we could say.

104
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
In a lot of applications, symmetric matrices show up.

105
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
So can I just call attention to symmetric matrices?

106
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What does that mean? What does that word symmetric mean? It means that this transposing doesn't change the matrix.

107
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
A transpose equals A. And an example.

108
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,799
So, let's take a matrix that's symmetric,

109
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
so whatever is sitting on the diagonal -- but now what's above the diagonal, like a one,

110
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
had better be there, a seven had better be here, a nine had better be there.

111
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There's a symmetric matrix. I happened to use all positive numbers as its entries.

112
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's not the point. The point is that if I transpose that matrix, I get it back again.

113
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So symmetric matrices have this property A transpose equals A. I guess at this point --

114
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm just asking you to notice this family of matrices that

115
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
are unchanged by transposing. And they're easy to identify, of course.

116
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You know, it's not maybe so easy before we had a case where

117
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
the transpose gave the inverse. That's highly important, but not so simple to see.

118
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is the case where the transpose gives the same matrix back again. That's totally simple to see.

119
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay. Could actually -- maybe I could even say when would we get such

120
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
a matrix? For example, this -- that matrix is absolutely far from

121
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
symmetric, right? The transpose isn't even the same shape --

122
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
because it's rectangular, it turns the -- lies down on its side.

123
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But let me tell you a way to get a symmetric matrix out of this.

124
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Multiply those together. If I multiply this rectangular, shall I

125
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
call it R for rectangular? So let that be R for rectangular matrix

126
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and let that be R transpose, which it is. Then I think that if I multiply those together,

127
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I get a symmetric matrix. Can I just do it with the numbers and then ask you why, how did I know it would be symmetric?

128
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So my point is that R transpose R is always symmetric.

129
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,500
Okay?

130
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And I'm going to do it for that particular R transpose R which was --

131
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
let's see, the column was one two four three three one.

132
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I called that one R transpose, didn't I, and I called this guy one two four three three one.

133
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I called that R. Shall we just do that multiplication? Okay, so up here I'm getting a ten.

134
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Next to it I'm getting two, a nine, I'm getting an eleven. Next to that I'm getting four and three, a seven.

135
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Now what do I get there? This eleven came from one three times two three, right?

136
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Row one, column two. What goes here? Row two, column one.

137
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But no difference. One three two three or two three one three, same thing.

138
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's going to be an eleven. That's the symmetry. I can continue to fill it out.

139
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What -- oh, let's get that seven. That seven will show up down here, too, and then four more numbers.

140
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That seven will show up here because one three times four one gave the seven, but also four one times one three

141
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
will give that seven. Do you see that it works?

142
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Actually, do you want to see it work also in matrix language?

143
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I mean, that's quite convincing, right? That seven is no accident.

144
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The eleven is no accident.

145
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But just tell me how do I know if I transpose this guy --

146
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:49,000
How do I know it's symmetric? Well, I'm going to transpose it. And when I transpose it, I'm hoping

147
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I get the matrix back again. So can I transpose R transpose R?

148
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So just -- so, why?

149
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,799
Well, my suggestion is take the transpose.

150
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's the only way to show it's symmetric. Take the transpose and see that it didn't change. Okay, so I take the transpose of R transpose R.

151
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay. How do I do that? This is our little practice on the rules for transposes.

152
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
So the rule for transposes is the order gets reversed.

153
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Just like inverses, which we did prove, same rule for transposes and -- which we'll now use.

154
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So the order gets reversed. It's the transpose of that that comes first,

155
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and the transpose of this that comes -- no.

156
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Is that -- yeah. That's what I have to write, right? This is a product of two matrices and I want its

157
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
transpose. So I put the matrices in the opposite order and I transpose them. But what have I got here?

158
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What is R transpose transpose?

159
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Well, don't all speak at once. R transpose transpose, I flipped over the diagonal,

160
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I flipped over the diagonal again, so I've got R.

161
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And that's just my point, that if I started with this matrix, I transposed it, I got it back again.

162
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So that's the check, without using numbers, but with --

163
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
it checked in two lines that I always get symmetric matrices

164
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
this way. And actually, that's where they come from in so many practical applications.

165
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay. So now I've said something today about permutations and about

166
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,799
transposes and about symmetry and I'm ready

167
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
for chapter three. Can we take a breath --

168
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:31,000
the tape won't take a breath, but the lecturer will, because to tell you about vector spaces is --

169
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
we really have to start now and think, okay, listen up.

170
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,599
What are vector spaces?

171
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,400
And what are sub-spaces? Okay. So, the point is, The main operations that we do --

172
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
what do we do with vectors? We add them. We know how to add two vectors.

173
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We multiply them by numbers, usually called scalers.

174
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:24,000
If we have a vector, we know what three V is. If we have a vector V and W, we know what V plus W is.

175
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Those are the two operations that we've got to be able to do.

176
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
To legitimately talk about a space of vectors, the requirement is that we should

177
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:44,000
be able to add the things and multiply by numbers and that there should be some decent rules satisfied.

178
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,599
Okay. So let me start with examples. So I'm talking now about vector spaces.

179
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,799
And I'm going to start with examples.

180
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Let me say again what this word space is meaning. When I say that word space, that means to me

181
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
that I've got a bunch of vectors, a space of vectors.

182
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:28,000
But not just any bunch of vectors. It has to be a space of vectors --

183
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:37,000
has to allow me to do the operations that vectors are for. I have to be able to add vectors and multiply by numbers.

184
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I have to be able to take linear combinations. Well, where did we meet linear combinations?

185
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We met them back in, say in R^2.

186
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So there's a vector space. What's that vector space?

187
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
So R two is telling me I'm talking about real numbers

188
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and I'm talking about two real numbers. So this is all two dimensional vectors --

189
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,599
real, such as --

190
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:30,000
well, I'm not going to be able to list them all. But let me put a few down. |3; 2|, |0;0|, |pi; e|.

191
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,500
So on.

192
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And it's natural -- okay. Let's see, I guess I should do algebra first.

193
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Algebra means what can I do to these vectors? I can add them. I can add that to that.

194
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And how do I do it? A component at a time, of course. Three two added to zero zero gives me, three two.

195
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Sorry about that. Three two added to pi e gives me three plus pi, two plus e.

196
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh, you know what it does. And you know the picture that goes with it.

197
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:19,000
There's the vector three two. And often, the picture has an arrow.

198
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The vector zero zero, which is a highly important vector -- it's got, like, the most important here

199
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
-- is there. And of course there's not much of an arrow.

200
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Pi -- I'll have to remember -- pi is about three and a little

201
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
more, e is about two and a little more. So maybe there's pi e.

202
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I never drew pi e before. It's just natural to --

203
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,200
this is the first component on the horizontal

204
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
and this is the second component, going up the vertical.

205
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Okay. And the whole plane is R two.

206
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So R two is, we could say, the plane.

207
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,799
The xy plane. That's what everybody thinks.

208
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
But the point is it's a vector space because all those vectors

209
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
are in there. If I removed one of them -- Suppose I removed zero zero.

210
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Suppose I tried to take the -- considered the X Y plane with a puncture, with a point removed.

211
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Like the origin. That would be, like, awful to take the origin away. Why is that?

212
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Why do I need the origin there? Because I have to be allowed -- if I had these other vectors,

213
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I have to be allowed to multiply three two -- this was three two --

214
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
by anything, by any scaler, including zero. I've got to be allowed to multiply by zero

215
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
and the result's got to be there. I can't do without that point.

216
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And I have to be able to add three two to the opposite guy,

217
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
minus three minus two. And if I add those I'm back to the origin again.

218
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
No way I can do without the origin. Every vector space has got that zero vector in it.

219
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Okay, that's an easy vector space, because we have a natural picture of it.

220
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Okay. Similarly easy is R^3.

221
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,000
This would be all -- let me go up a little here. This would be --

222
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:09,000
R three would be all three dimensional vectors -- or shall I say vectors with three real components.

223
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,500
Okay.

224
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Let me just to be sure we're together,

225
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,200
let me take the vector three two zero.

226
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Is that a vector in R^2 or R^3? Definitely it's in R^3.

227
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's got three components. One of them happens to be zero, but that's a perfectly okay number.

228
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So that's a vector in R^3. We don't want to mix up the --

229
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I mean, keep these vectors straight and keep R^n straight. So what's R^n?

230
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
R^n. So this is our big example, is all vectors with n components.

231
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I'm making these darn things column vectors.

232
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Can I try to follow that convention, that they'll be column vectors, and their components should

233
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,000
be real numbers. Later we'll need complex numbers and complex vectors,

234
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
but much later. Okay. So that's a vector space.

235
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Now, let's see. What do I have to tell you about vector spaces? I said the most important thing, which is that we can add any

236
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
two of these and we -- still in R^2. We can multiply by any number and we're still in R^2.

237
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
We can take any combination and we're still in R^2. And same goes for R^n.

238
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's -- honesty requires me to mention that these operations

239
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
of adding and multiplying have to obey a few rules.

240
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Like, we can't just arbitrarily say, okay, the sum of three two and pi e is zero zero.

241
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,000
It's not. The sum of three two and minus three two is zero zero.

242
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So -- oh, I'm not going to -- the book, actually, lists the eight rules that the addition and multiplication

243
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
have to satisfy, but they do. They certainly satisfy it in R^n and usually it's not those

244
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:50,000
eight rules that are in doubt. What's -- the question is, can we do those additions and do we

245
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
stay in the space? Let me show you a case where you can't.

246
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,400
So suppose this is going to be not a vector space.

247
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Suppose I take the xy plane -- so there's R^2. That is a vector space.

248
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Now suppose I just take part of it. Just this.

249
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Just this one -- this is one quarter of the vector space.

250
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
All the vectors with positive or at least not negative

251
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,400
components. Can I add those safely?

252
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Yes. If I add a vector with, like, two -- three two to another vector like five six,

253
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm still up in this quarter, no problem with adding. But there's a heck of a problem with multiplying by scalers,

254
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
because there's a lot of scalers that will take me out of this quarter plane, like negative ones.

255
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
If I took three two and I multiplied by minus five, I'm way down here.

256
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So that's not a vector space, because it's not -- closed is the right word.

257
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's not closed under multiplication by all real numbers.

258
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So a vector space has to be closed under multiplication

259
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and addition of vectors. In other words, linear combinations. It -- so, it means that if I give you a few vectors --

260
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:47,000
yeah look, here's an important -- here -- now we're getting to some really important vector spaces. Well, R^n -- like, they are the most important.

261
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But we will be interested in so- in vector spaces that are

262
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,400
inside R^n. Vector spaces that follow the rules, but they --

263
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,000
we don't need all of -- see, there we started with R^2 here,

264
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
and took part of it and messed it up. What we got was not a vector space.

265
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Now tell me a vector space that is part of R^2 and is still

266
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
safely -- we can multiply, we can add and we stay in this

267
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:40,000
smaller vector space. So it's going to be called a subspace. So I'm going to change this bad example to a good one.

268
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Okay. So I'm going to start again with R^2, but I'm going to take an example -- it is a vector space,

269
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
so it'll be a vector space inside R^2.

270
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,200
And we'll call that a subspace of R^2.

271
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Okay. What can I do?

272
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's got something in it. Suppose it's got this vector in it.

273
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Okay. If that vector's in my little subspace

274
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and it's a true subspace, then there's got to be some more in it,

275
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:33,000
right? I have to be able to multiply that by two, and that double vector has to be included.

276
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Have to be able to multiply by zero, that vector, or by half, or by three quarters.

277
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
All these vectors. Or by minus a half, or by minus one.

278
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I have to be able to multiply by any number. So that is going to say that I have to have that whole line.

279
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Do you see that? Once I get a vector in there --

280
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I've got the whole line of all multiples of that vector. I can't have a vector space without extending to get

281
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,000
those multiples in there. Now I still have to check addition.

282
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But that comes out okay. This line is going to work, because I could add something

283
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,000
on the line to something else on the line and I'm still on the line.

284
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So, example. So this is all examples of a subspace --

285
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,199
our example is a line in R^2 actually -- not just any line.

286
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
If I took this line, would that --

287
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
so all the vectors on that line. So that vector and that vector and this vector and this vector

288
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
-- in lighter type, I'm drawing something that doesn't work.

289
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's not a subspace. The line in R^2 -- to be a subspace, the line in R^2 must go through the zero vector.

290
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Because -- why is this line no good?

291
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,400
Let me do a dashed line.

292
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Because if I multiplied that vector on the dashed line by zero, then I'm down here, I'm not on the dashed line.

293
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Z- zero's got to be. Every subspace has got to contain zero --

294
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,000
because I must be allowed to multiply by zero and that will always give me the zero vector.

295
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Okay. Now, I was going to make --

296
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
create some subspaces. Oh, while I'm in R^2, why don't we think of all

297
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
the possibilities. R two, there can't be that many. So what are the possible subspaces of R^2?

298
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Let me list them. So I'm listing now the subspaces of R^2.

299
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,800
And one possibility that we always allow

300
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
is all of R two, the whole thing, the whole space.

301
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That counts as a subspace of itself. You always want to allow that.

302
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Then the others are lines -- any line, meaning infinitely far in both directions

303
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,500
through the zero.

304
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So that's like the whole space -- that's like whole two D space.

305
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This is like one dimension. Is this line the same as R^1 ? No.

306
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You could say it looks a lot like R^1. R^1 was just a line and this is a line.

307
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But this is a line inside R^2. The vectors here have two components.

308
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So that's not the same as R^1, because there the vectors only have one component.

309
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Very close, you could say, but not the same. Okay. And now there's a third possibility.

310
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
There's a third subspace that's --

311
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
of R^2 that's not the whole thing, and it's not a line.

312
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,599
It's even less. It's just the zero vector alone. The zero vector alone, only.

313
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'll often call this subspace Z, just for zero. Here's a line, L.

314
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Here's a plane, all of R^2. So, do you see that the zero vector's okay?

315
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You would just -- to understand subspaces, we have to know the rules -- and knowing the rules means that we

316
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,000
have to see that yes, the zero vector by itself, just this guy alone satisfies the rules.

317
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Why's that? Oh, it's too dumb to tell you. If I took that and added it to itself, I'm still there.

318
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,000
If I took that and multiplied by seventeen, I'm still there. So I've done the operations, adding and multiplying

319
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
by numbers, that are required, and I didn't go outside this one point space.

320
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,199
So that's always -- that's the littlest subspace.

321
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And the largest subspace is the whole thing and in-between come all --

322
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
whatever's in between. Okay. So for example, what's in between for R^3?

323
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So if I'm in ordinary three dimensions, the subspace is R, all of R^3 at one extreme, the zero vector at the bottom.

324
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And then a plane, a plane through the origin.

325
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Or a line, a line through the origin. So with R^3, the subspaces were R^3, plane through the origin,

326
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:43,000
line through the origin and a zero vector by itself, zero zero zero, just that single vector.

327
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,599
Okay, you've got the idea. But, now comes --

328
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
the reality is -- what are these -- where do these subspaces come --

329
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:06,000
how do they come out of matrices? And I want to take this matrix --

330
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:17,000
oh, let me take that matrix. So I want to create some subspaces out of that matrix.

331
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,800
Well, one subspace is from the columns.

332
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,800
Okay. So this is the important subspace,

333
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
the first important subspace that comes from that matrix -- I'm going to -- let me call it A again.

334
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Back to -- okay. I'm looking at the columns of A.

335
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Those are vectors in R^3. So the columns are in R^3. The columns are in R^3.

336
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So I want those columns to be in my subspace.

337
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Now I can't just put two columns in my subspace

338
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and call it a subspace. What do I have to throw in -- if I'm going to put those two

339
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:25,000
columns in, what else has got to be there to have a subspace? I must be able to add those things.

340
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:34,000
So the sum of those columns -- so these columns are in R^3, and I have to be able --

341
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm, you know, I want that to be in my subspace, I want that to be in my subspace, but therefore I have to be able to multiply them by anything.

342
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Zero zero zero has got to be in my subspace. I have to be able to add them so that four five five

343
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
is in the subspace. I've got to be able to add one of these plus three of these. That'll give me some other vector.

344
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I have to be able to take all the linear combinations.

345
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,400
So these are columns in R^3 and all there linear combinations

346
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,500
form a subspace.

347
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What do I mean by linear combinations? I mean multiply that by something, multiply that by something and add.

348
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
The two operations of linear algebra, multiplying by numbers

349
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
and adding vectors. And, if I include all the results,

350
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,000
then I'm guaranteed to have a subspace. I've done the job.

351
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And we'll give it a name -- the column space.

352
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,500
Column space.

353
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And maybe I'll call it C of A. C for column space.

354
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,400
There's an idea there that --

355
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Like, the central idea for today's lecture is --

356
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,000
got a few vectors. Not satisfied with a few vectors, we want a space of vectors.

357
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:37,000
The vectors, they're in -- these vectors in -- are in R^3 , so our space of vectors will be vectors in R^3.

358
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
The key idea's -- we have to be able to take their combinations.

359
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,000
So tell me, geometrically, if I drew all these things -- like if I drew one two four, that would be somewhere maybe

360
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,000
there. If I drew three three one, who knows, might be -- I don't know, I'll say there.

361
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:06,000
There's column one, there's column two. What else -- what's in the whole column space?

362
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,000
How do I draw the whole column space now? I take all combinations of those two vectors.

363
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Do I get -- well, I guess I actually listed the possibilities.

364
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Do I get the whole space? Do I get a plane?

365
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I get more than a line, that's for sure. And I certainly get more than the zero vector, but I do get the zero vector included.

366
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:39,000
What do I get if I combine -- take all the combinations of two vectors in R^3 ?

367
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,199
So I've got all this stuff on --

368
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,000
that whole line gets filled out, that whole line gets filled out, but all in-between gets filled out -- between the two lines because I --

369
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I allowed to add something from one line, something from the other. You see what's coming?

370
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,599
I'm getting a plane.

371
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That's my -- and it's through the origin.

372
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Those two vectors, namely one two four and three three one,

373
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:25,000
when I take all their combinations, I fill out a whole plane. Please think about that.

374
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That's the picture you have to see. You sure have to see it in R^3 , because we're going to do it

375
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:40,000
in R^10, and we may take a combination of five vectors in R^10, and what will we have?

376
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
God knows. It's some subspace. We'll have five vectors.

377
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
They'll all have ten components. We take their combinations.

378
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
We don't have R^5 , because our vectors have ten components.

379
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And we possibly have, like, some five dimensional flat thing

380
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
going through the origin for sure. Well, of course, if those five vectors were all on the line,

381
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:21,000
then we would only get that line. So, you see, there are, like, other possibilities here. It depends what -- it depends on those five vectors.

382
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Just like if our two columns had been on the same line, then the column space would have been only a line.

383
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,400
Here it was a plane. Okay.

384
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'm going to stop at that point. That's the central idea of -- the great example of how

385
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,000
to create a subspace from a matrix. Take its columns, take their combinations,

386
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
all their linear combinations and you get the column space.

387
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And that's the central sort of -- we're looking at linear algebra at a higher level.

388
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
When I look at A -- now, I want to look at Ax=b. That'll be the first thing in the next lecture.

389
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,000
How do I understand Ax=b in this language --

390
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
in this new language of vector spaces and column spaces.

391
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And what are other subspaces? So the column space is a big one, there are others to come.

392
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,500
Okay, thanks.
